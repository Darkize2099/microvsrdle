A comforting thought, I imagine, for those seeking redemption, but, I tell you, put such thoughts from your mind. You need only peer into a demon’s eyes to know evil is not some vacuum waiting for virtue to come and fill its emptiness. Evil is a force. It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable. Understand, there is no redemption, only treason against the side you were born to serve.",

Thankfully, Galar’s greatest warriors, Zacian and Zamazenta, arrived and teamed up with the twin kings of Galar, and the four managed to defeat him in battle, putting him back to sleep underneath what is now Hammerlocke Stadium. 3000 years later, Chairman Rose foresaw an energy crisis that would plague the Galar region in a millennium, and he woke Eternatus back up with the faith that Leon would be able to defeat and capture him so they would never run out of Dynamax energy. The tag team effort of Leon and Victor was able to defeat his Base form, however Eternatus had absorbed enough energy to reach Eternamax again and start another Darkest Day. Zacian and Zamazenta once again came to the aid of the Galar region and fought alongside Victor and Hop to defeat Eternatus a second time. Victor ended up catching Eternatus after all, so in a way Chairman Rose awakening him was not in vain.",

Deeming the council's actions to be destroying the Multiverse, Richards sparked the Multiversal War, seeking to conquer as many worlds as possible as Kang the Conqueror. However, the council decided to banish him to the Quantum Realm, where he allied with Janet van Dyne to rebuild his Time Sphere, until he was betrayed after van Dyne discovered his true nature. Kang was once again trapped in the Quantum Realm, using that time to conquer part of it and build an empire in Axia.",

Odin hung himself on Yggdrasil for nine days, pierced by his own spear, until by virtue of his suggering he was able to reach down and seize magical runes that were the source of wisdom and magical Lore. His suffering so impressed the son of the giant Bolthor that he taught Odin nine magical songs that allowed him to master eighteen magical spells previously unknown to any man or woman. Odin is fated to be swallowed by Loki's son Fenrir at Ragnarok, but his own son Vidar will avenge him. Wearing a dark, wide-brimmed hat that casts a shadow over his face, Odin travels as a mortal wanderer. As a god of magic, war, and wisdom, he visits Midgard to distribute knowledge and victory in battle. His many titles hint at his various roles.",

It is said that he is one of (if not the most) powerful demon lord, with massive physical strength coming from his massive frame (standing 15 ft tall and weighing 6,000 lbs).",

After Mustard stepped down from being the Galar League Champion, Peony seized the opportunity and became Champion himself, however he soon stepped down too when he discovered that Rose had become the Chairman of Macro Cosmos. Many years later, he had a daughter, Peonia, who he still has a difficult relationship with to this day as she rejects any of his attempts to help or get close to her, though that never once stops him from trying. It is unknown if Peony is aware that Rose was arrested after causing the second Darkest Day.",

Such as the renown of this battle that they gained the nicknames Two-Faced Goddess or Sisters-Who-Were-One. At their creation they brought into being the goddess Chauntea, and the three goddesses, representing light, dark, and matter, blessed the voids with life and order. Ultimately, this led to their conflict- Shar desired life to remain cold and filled with suffering, eventually returning to nothingness. Thus the battle began.",

    "Summary": "Eternatus is a gigantic alien dragon that slept inside a meteorite that fell to Earth 20,000 years ago. 17,000 years later, Eternatus woke up and started absorbing energy from his surroundings, eventually leading him to reach his Eternamax form and causing a historical event called the Darkest Day, where a massive black cloud covered the Galar region and caused nearly every Pokemon in the region to Dynamax and run rampant. Thankfully, Galar’s greatest warriors, Zacian and Zamazenta, arrived and teamed up with the twin kings of Galar, and the four managed to defeat him in battle, putting him back to sleep underneath what is now Hammerlocke Stadium. 3000 years later, Chairman Rose foresaw an energy crisis that would plague the Galar region in a millennium, and he woke Eternatus back up with the faith that Leon would be able to defeat and capture him so they would never run out of Dynamax energy. The tag team effort of Leon and Victor was able to defeat his Base form, however Eternatus had absorbed enough energy to reach Eternamax again and start another Darkest Day. Zacian and Zamazenta once again came to the aid of the Galar region and fought alongside Victor and Hop to defeat Eternatus a second time. Victor ended up catching Eternatus after all, so in a way Chairman Rose awakening him was not in vain.",

Cloud shines brightly and he and Sephiroth depart to places unknown to continue their battle. Tifa thanks Sora for his help in locating Cloud and gives him the Fenrir Keychain. She later appears as a boss in several cups in the Underworld Coliseum, fighting with the other Final Fantasy characters. Tifa was intended to appear alongside Cloud and Sephiroth in the original Kingdom Hearts, but she was removed due to time constraints.",

It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable.

Atrocitus, however, convinced Abin Sur to free him by using his knowledge of the prophecy of the Blackest Night--later manipulating Abin Sur into experiencing fear, and ultimately mortally wounding Abin Sur, directly causing the events that would lead to Hal Jordan becoming the new Green Lantern of his Sector. Later, on Ysmault, he performed a blood ritual, slaying three of the four Inversions and using their blood to create the first Red Power Battery and ring. He then christened the battery in the last Inversion's blood, thus establishing the Red Lantern Corps.",

    "Summary": "Duo.EXE is a powerful extraterrestrial NetNavi that MegaMan.EXE encounters in the fourth Battle Network game. Duo observes the inhabitants of planets and judges whether they are good or evil overall, destroying them if they are the latter.The machinations of Dr. Regal led him to judge humanity as evil and thus tried to destroy the planet. MegaMan.EXE later confronts Duo after defeating his inner darkness, defeating him after a grueling battle and causing Duo to have a change of heart and allowed Mega Man access to the controls of the comet set to destroy Earth as a final test. Although the young NetNavi was too weak to do it alone, the combined sentiment of all of his friends and the people of Earth allowed him to take the reins and avert Earth's destruction. In the anime Duo's role is similar, but the NetNavi is vastly more powerful, easily defeating MegaMan.EXE and co. before destroying the Earth after Regal once again made Duo doubt the worth of humanity's existence. Only Baryl's sacrifice and the trust required to perform Cross Fusion made him change his mind and revert the damage.",

I've reincarnated across time, stretching back to the dawn of man. I ruled as an ancient Egyptian prince. Battled as a medieval knight. Dueled as an Old West gunhand. Yet lately, I'm plagued by the thought that the subject I know the least about is myself. That pieces of my history are missing. There remains only one truth that I know to be certain -- I am made to soar. I can't remember a life when I wasn't enthralled by flight. Open skies. Then why do I spend so much time underground? Darkness. Suffocating spaces. It's because the past is buried. And I'm swept up in the pursuit of it like a sparrow in a gale. Driven by the twin compulsions of my existence. Exploration and discovery.",

When Lobo was born, his evil was so frighteningly apparent, the nurse who delivered him went insane and became the planet's first mental patient in ten millennia after the infant Lobo chewed off four of her fingers. Lobo knew he was one of a kind, but he wanted even more. Inspired by the idea of genocide, Lobo created a swarm of lethal scorpion-like creatures, he set them on his people wiping out his entire species but himself. He claimed it was a science project and gave himself an 'A'. Since then, he has traveled the galaxies collecting bounties. Despite his ruthless nature, Lobo has a strict code of honor when it comes to these agreements. Along the way, he has met and battled a number of superheroes.",

The fiends know (or do they simply believe?) that not even the Oinoloth would dare lie about such a thing. Among the 'loths, that sort of respect is truly power.",

Contrary to the other gods, Yuga Khan held little concern over ephemeral trivialities such as glory or control over the universe, and was of the mind that, as eternal beings, Gods should strive towards equally immortal aspirations, lest they become much like mortals and eventually perish themselves. As such, he sought to expand the breadth of his power and knowledge, gaining knowledge over everything that there is to know, and eventually became obsessed with attaining knowledge over the final mystery underlying all of existence: The Source itself.",

You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable.

    "Summary": "Atrocitus is a Red Lantern and an enemy of the Guardians of the Universe, and the Sinestro Corps. He was originally the leader of The Five Inversions, having joined the group after escaping the genocide committed by the Manhunters and watching them kill his family, and thereupon established the Empire of Tears that spanned a great swathe of space, until their eventual imprisonment and defeat. Atrocitus, however, convinced Abin Sur to free him by using his knowledge of the prophecy of the Blackest Night--later manipulating Abin Sur into experiencing fear, and ultimately mortally wounding Abin Sur, directly causing the events that would lead to Hal Jordan becoming the new Green Lantern of his Sector. Later, on Ysmault, he performed a blood ritual, slaying three of the four Inversions and using their blood to create the first Red Power Battery and ring. He then christened the battery in the last Inversion's blood, thus establishing the Red Lantern Corps.",

Regardless, the character still steared closely to her creator's original idea, her origin story being given as that of an agent pertaining to a secret governmental organization nominated Alpha-13, who, in a mention with the objective of thwarting the supervillain Madame Atom's plan of detonating a nuclear drill within a Ziggurat holding vast amounts of divine power within itself, thus taking the elemental force of an unspecified Sumerian god unto her body and becoming the most powerful being in the Universe. Attempting to deactivate Atom's drill by hand, Caroline eventually ran low on time and the drill exploded within the Ziggurat, embuing her with the powerful magic contained in the construction and drastically mutating her appearance into that of an inorganic, blue-skinned chimeric humanoid, as a result granting her the power to fully control her own atomic structure, thus turning her into the titular Formless Girl.",

Duo observes the inhabitants of planets and judges whether they are good or evil overall, destroying them if they are the latter.The machinations of Dr. Regal led him to judge humanity as evil and thus tried to destroy the planet. MegaMan.EXE later confronts Duo after defeating his inner darkness, defeating him after a grueling battle and causing Duo to have a change of heart and allowed Mega Man access to the controls of the comet set to destroy Earth as a final test. Although the young NetNavi was too weak to do it alone, the combined sentiment of all of his friends and the people of Earth allowed him to take the reins and avert Earth's destruction. In the anime Duo's role is similar, but the NetNavi is vastly more powerful, easily defeating MegaMan.EXE and co. before destroying the Earth after Regal once again made Duo doubt the worth of humanity's existence. Only Baryl's sacrifice and the trust required to perform Cross Fusion made him change his mind and revert the damage.",

Thankfully, Galar’s greatest warriors, Zacian and Zamazenta, arrived and teamed up with the twin kings of Galar, and the four managed to defeat him in battle, putting him back to sleep underneath what is now Hammerlocke Stadium. 3000 years later, Chairman Rose foresaw an energy crisis that would plague the Galar region in a millennium, and he woke Eternatus back up with the faith that Leon would be able to defeat and capture him so they would never run out of Dynamax energy. The tag team effort of Leon and Victor was able to defeat his Base form, however Eternatus had absorbed enough energy to reach Eternamax again and start another Darkest Day. Zacian and Zamazenta once again came to the aid of the Galar region and fought alongside Victor and Hop to defeat Eternatus a second time. Victor ended up catching Eternatus after all, so in a way Chairman Rose awakening him was not in vain.",

Darkness. Suffocating spaces. It's because the past is buried. And I'm swept up in the pursuit of it like a sparrow in a gale. Driven by the twin compulsions of my existence.

Many of the fragments ended up on Earth, after the space ship transporting them was shot down thousands of years ago. Around 5,000 years ago, the Ka Stone was found by Anath-Na Mut in the temple of the Ka. He had wandered in the desert for 90 years after his defeat at the hands of Moses and being expelled from his duties as chief wizard to Ramses II. The Ka Stone empowered Anath-Na Mut and turned him into the Sphinx. As the Sphinx he became an immortal, with godlike power.",

He hailed from the planet Czarnia which was a virtual paradise that knew nothing of war and the Czarnians were almost immortal. When Lobo was born, his evil was so frighteningly apparent, the nurse who delivered him went insane and became the planet's first mental patient in ten millennia after the infant Lobo chewed off four of her fingers. Lobo knew he was one of a kind, but he wanted even more. Inspired by the idea of genocide, Lobo created a swarm of lethal scorpion-like creatures, he set them on his people wiping out his entire species but himself. He claimed it was a science project and gave himself an 'A'. Since then, he has traveled the galaxies collecting bounties. Despite his ruthless nature, Lobo has a strict code of honor when it comes to these agreements. Along the way, he has met and battled a number of superheroes.",

He once stole the mead of poetry, and some myths say he grants poetic ability and inspiration to mortals. Odin hung himself on Yggdrasil for nine days, pierced by his own spear, until by virtue of his suggering he was able to reach down and seize magical runes that were the source of wisdom and magical Lore. His suffering so impressed the son of the giant Bolthor that he taught Odin nine magical songs that allowed him to master eighteen magical spells previously unknown to any man or woman. Odin is fated to be swallowed by Loki's son Fenrir at Ragnarok, but his own son Vidar will avenge him. Wearing a dark, wide-brimmed hat that casts a shadow over his face, Odin travels as a mortal wanderer. As a god of magic, war, and wisdom, he visits Midgard to distribute knowledge and victory in battle. His many titles hint at his various roles.",

It was while he was a delinquent that his skill for raising Steel type Pokemon was recognized, and he soon even became a Gym Leader. After Mustard stepped down from being the Galar League Champion, Peony seized the opportunity and became Champion himself, however he soon stepped down too when he discovered that Rose had become the Chairman of Macro Cosmos. Many years later, he had a daughter, Peonia, who he still has a difficult relationship with to this day as she rejects any of his attempts to help or get close to her, though that never once stops him from trying. It is unknown if Peony is aware that Rose was arrested after causing the second Darkest Day.",

Alongside Shar, Selune emerged as her opposite- light and dark, yin and yang, decreed by Ao to battle for all eternity in an endless stalemate. Such as the renown of this battle that they gained the nicknames Two-Faced Goddess or Sisters-Who-Were-One. At their creation they brought into being the goddess Chauntea, and the three goddesses, representing light, dark, and matter, blessed the voids with life and order. Ultimately, this led to their conflict- Shar desired life to remain cold and filled with suffering, eventually returning to nothingness. Thus the battle began.",

Whatever the truth of the General, it exerts a powerful pull on the hearts and minds of all yugoloths- and especially the newest ultroloths. Just as some say the ultroloths conspire to create the fiction of the baernaloths, others believe that the Oinoloth sees to it that the legend of the General lives on. When the Oinoloth issues a decree from the General, all the factions listen. The myth and reputation of the General alone are enough to unite all yugoloths under a common goal. The fiends know (or do they simply believe?) that not even the Oinoloth would dare lie about such a thing. Among the 'loths, that sort of respect is truly power.",

On Qward, Sinestro met the weaponer and the weaponers of Qward, and told them of the yellow impurity, how the Green Lantern Power Rings could not affect anything colored Yellow. Having been working on a weapon similar to the power rings for several millennia, the weaponer and the rest of the Weaponers of Qward developed the Yellow Lantern Power Ring, designed to project yellow energy and take advantage of the Green Lanterns' weaknesses. With the establishment of the Sinestro Corps, those who are given membership in the organization are given a Yellow Lantern Power Ring and Qwardian Power Battery, which is connected to the Qwardian Central Power Battery on Qward.",

A comforting thought, I imagine, for those seeking redemption, but, I tell you, put such thoughts from your mind. You need only peer into a demon’s eyes to know evil is not some vacuum waiting for virtue to come and fill its emptiness. Evil is a force. It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable. Understand, there is no redemption, only treason against the side you were born to serve.",

Regardless, the character still steared closely to her creator's original idea, her origin story being given as that of an agent pertaining to a secret governmental organization nominated Alpha-13, who, in a mention with the objective of thwarting the supervillain Madame Atom's plan of detonating a nuclear drill within a Ziggurat holding vast amounts of divine power within itself, thus taking the elemental force of an unspecified Sumerian god unto her body and becoming the most powerful being in the Universe. Attempting to deactivate Atom's drill by hand, Caroline eventually ran low on time and the drill exploded within the Ziggurat, embuing her with the powerful magic contained in the construction and drastically mutating her appearance into that of an inorganic, blue-skinned chimeric humanoid, as a result granting her the power to fully control her own atomic structure, thus turning her into the titular Formless Girl.",

She follows a strict diet, only consuming the biomass of alien lifeforms who threaten Earth, so that way she can simultaneously protect her world, and (Temporarily, barely) quench her hunger. More recently, Galacta's Cosmic Hunger has become far worse due to the presence of an endosymbiotic energy parasite within her Power Cosmic lifeform, which she dubbed the \"Cosmic Tapeworm\".",

    "Summary": "Now, the General of Gehenna is said to be many things. The first and strongest ultroloth. A returned baenaloth. The leader of the yugoloth race. The keeper of all fiendish knowledge. A symbol to be revered and respected. The most fearsome creature in the multiverse. A god-slayer. Whatever the truth of the General, it exerts a powerful pull on the hearts and minds of all yugoloths- and especially the newest ultroloths. Just as some say the ultroloths conspire to create the fiction of the baernaloths, others believe that the Oinoloth sees to it that the legend of the General lives on. When the Oinoloth issues a decree from the General, all the factions listen. The myth and reputation of the General alone are enough to unite all yugoloths under a common goal. The fiends know (or do they simply believe?) that not even the Oinoloth would dare lie about such a thing. Among the 'loths, that sort of respect is truly power.",

His story did not end there, as he soon finds himself in Castle Oblivion's basement, having been guided there by Sora's heart. He takes this opportunity to continue assisting Sora from the shadows, but struggles with the darkness in his heart in spite of his attempts to embrace the light.",

Unbeknownst to him, many of these weapons are forgeries, and he's almost always seen with Excalipoor, a pale imitation of Excalibur that can only inflict shallow wounds, mistaking the false sword for the blade he seeks. After his second defeat at the hands of the Warrior of Light, Gilgamesh was sent tumbling through the Interdimensional Void, reappearing at many points throughout the franchise's history as an ally to be summoned or an optional foe to test the party's might for great rewards.",

Unbeknownst to him, many of these weapons are forgeries, and he's almost always seen with Excalipoor, a pale imitation of Excalibur that can only inflict shallow wounds, mistaking the false sword for the blade he seeks. After his second defeat at the hands of the Warrior of Light, Gilgamesh was sent tumbling through the Interdimensional Void, reappearing at many points throughout the franchise's history as an ally to be summoned or an optional foe to test the party's might for great rewards.",

He is very stoic, reserved, and calm, gathered by the fact that he remains unmoved even when guns are pointed at him.

Separated from his friends, Maleficent discovers his potential power and manipulates him into believing that Sora had forgotten and replaced him, stoking the inner darkness within Riku and turning him into an unwitting pawn despite his suspicions.

His story did not end there, as he soon finds himself in Castle Oblivion's basement, having been guided there by Sora's heart.

Strong-armed and simple-minded, he serves as Jet the Hawk's right hand man and is usually at odds with his intellectually superior teammate, Wave the Swallow. Relying more on his brute strength, Storm is not the most skilled at riding Extreme Gear, but is still an adequate flyer while being able to match other physically fit opponents like Knuckles the Echidna.",

It is the main antagonistic force of the Subspace Emissary, acting as the source behind most threats faced by the heroes. Its goal is the absorption of the World of Trophy into Subspace, done by the usage of Subspace Bombs. As Tabuu cannot leave Subspace, most of the forces are located in the World of Trophy while Tabuu manipulates them from Subspace. Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",

    "Summary": "In the First Realm, only two races existed, the Oni, and the Dragons, beings who controlled creation and destruction, and who fought each other in an eternal stalemate. One day, however, a child who was born of both the Oni and the Dragon was born. This child, known as the First Spinjitzu Master, was sought by both races as a means to end the war. Seeing that the two races would never find peace and couldn't understand the balance that was necessary for existence, left the realm to create his own, which became known as Ninjago. However, as the balance dictates that a world must have both good and evil, the Overlord - the dark spirit that had always existed - emerged into the Realm. The First Spinjitzu Master and the Overlord fought tirelessly and endlessly until The Overlord created a stone army to finally kill him. Knowing that he would eventually lose, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land in two, the Overlord being sealed into The Dark Island. However, the Overlord saw the arrival of Lord Garmadon, and thus waited for the ultimate battle between good and evil. Eventually, his prediction came to pass, with Lord Garmadon being betrayed by the Serpentine and left to rot in the ocean, eventually landing on the island. Manipulating Lord Garmadon and starting the Celestial Clock's countdown, which would dictate the beginning of the battle, The Overlord tricked him into spreading darkness through the Garmatron into Ninjago, shifting the balance back to darkness and restoring his powers. Forcibly taking over Garmadon's body and regaining his true form, and proceeded to corrupt all of Ninjago. However, he was ultimately soundly defeated by Lloyd Garmadon, who had become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master and was purged from Ninjago. Unfortunately for the Ninjas, the site of his defeat was still a foothold for him to remain and allowed him to take over Borg Industries, whose headquarters were built upon it. Taking over New Ninjago City’s infrastructure and the entirety of their computer system, he began a campaign to drain Lloyd’s power in order to become the Golden Master, a legendary being of Serpentine lore who held the powers of The First Spinjitzu Master at his peak, and would be fated to enslave the world. Eventually fulfilling this role with the power of the Golden Weapons, the Overlord was defeated by Zane, who sacrificed himself to turn the Overlord’s power against himself at the cost of his own life, purging his darkness from Ninjago once more.",

    "Summary": "Xion is the fourteenth member of Organization XIII, first appearing in the game Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, in which she could be viewed as both a main protagonist and antagonist. She is not a normal Nobody and is only a nominal member of the Organization. Because of this, she does not have a throne in Where Nothing Gathers, nor does she have a title or a breed of Nobody to control. Instead, she is an imperfect Replica of Sora created from his leaked memories as a fail-safe in case both Sora and Roxas proved to be useless to Organization XIII's plans. While this enables her to use the Keyblade, Xion's existence also halts Sora's progression of regaining his memories to fully awaken while in his pod, something which Naminé, DiZ, and Riku recognize.",

Unfortunately, the jar contained the Hourai Elixir, which would trigger the volcano's eruption hard enough that not even Sakuyahime could stop it. As such, she convinced the humans to not drop it in the volcano. As a precaution, she also murdered most of them in their sleep. The two survivors had to carry away the Elixir, although one of them killed the other and took the Elixir for themselves. Said person will go on to become Fujiwara no Mokou.",

As Tabuu cannot leave Subspace, most of the forces are located in the World of Trophy while Tabuu manipulates them from Subspace. Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",

    "Summary": "In the First Realm, only two races existed, the Oni, and the Dragons, beings who controlled creation and destruction, and who fought each other in an eternal stalemate. One day, however, a child who was born of both the Oni and the Dragon was born. This child, known as the First Spinjitzu Master, was sought by both races as a means to end the war. Seeing that the two races would never find peace and couldn't understand the balance that was necessary for existence, left the realm to create his own, which became known as Ninjago. However, as the balance dictates that a world must have both good and evil, the Overlord - the dark spirit that had always existed - emerged into the Realm. The First Spinjitzu Master and the Overlord fought tirelessly and endlessly until The Overlord created a stone army to finally kill him. Knowing that he would eventually lose, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land in two, the Overlord being sealed into The Dark Island. However, the Overlord saw the arrival of Lord Garmadon, and thus waited for the ultimate battle between good and evil. Eventually, his prediction came to pass, with Lord Garmadon being betrayed by the Serpentine and left to rot in the ocean, eventually landing on the island. Manipulating Lord Garmadon and starting the Celestial Clock's countdown, which would dictate the beginning of the battle, The Overlord tricked him into spreading darkness through the Garmatron into Ninjago, shifting the balance back to darkness and restoring his powers. Forcibly taking over Garmadon's body and regaining his true form, and proceeded to corrupt all of Ninjago. However, he was ultimately soundly defeated by Lloyd Garmadon, who had become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master and was purged from Ninjago. Unfortunately for the Ninjas, the site of his defeat was still a foothold for him to remain and allowed him to take over Borg Industries, whose headquarters were built upon it. Taking over New Ninjago City’s infrastructure and the entirety of their computer system, he began a campaign to drain Lloyd’s power in order to become the Golden Master, a legendary being of Serpentine lore who held the powers of The First Spinjitzu Master at his peak, and would be fated to enslave the world. Eventually fulfilling this role with the power of the Golden Weapons, the Overlord was defeated by Zane, who sacrificed himself to turn the Overlord’s power against himself at the cost of his own life, purging his darkness from Ninjago once more.",
