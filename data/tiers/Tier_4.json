For the satyrs of the Skola Valley on Theros, pleasure, revelry, and mischief are virtues of the highest regard. Xenagos is the epitome of these ideals. While he does not rule the satyrs, Xenagos savors his role as de facto revelry host. When his Planeswalker spark ignited, he was excited to bring his boisterous, carefree hedonism to distant planes. His goal was to discover all the pleasures of the Multiverse...but what he found instead was disillusionment. On Theros, his gods were real, but elsewhere, they held no influence. This began to gnaw at Xenagos, who ultimately returned to his home plane. While he tried to throw himself back into the revelries, they no longer gave him the same level of amusement. The natural order of things on Theros had become a farce to Xenagos, and he refused to play the fool. Where once Xenagos lived only for the moment, his newfound awareness of the Multiverse had ruined his ability to lose himself in the bedlam of satyr festivities. However, he refuses to succumb to listlessness, and just as he has been known to push revelries a few steps too far, Xenagos is now working a plan to elevate himself from mortal to god.",

In the New 52 Action Comics (a series set some time before the events of Justice League #1), Luthor is hired by General Sam Lane to capture Superman by setting a train accident as a trap for him. The younger Superman, who is weaker and inexperienced, barely stops the train and is left unconscious. Lex collects Superman and subjects him to a series of tests to ascertain his strengths and weaknesses. He tortures Superman until the latter manages to escape. Lex is later revealed to have obtained contact with the \"Collector of Worlds\" through unknown means and was told to say the word \"Krypton\" to Superman. He later appears when the Collector abducts New Troy as one of the residents in the area. He along with Lois and Jimmy go into Glen Glenmorgan's hotel where Lex calls the Collector and it is revealed that Lex had made a deal with him. It is later revealed that Lex Luthor was the secret caller named \"Icarus\" that was giving secret information on Glen Glenmorgan to Clark Kent.",

Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flare-up that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. All observed novae involve closely located binary stars (the progenitors) - either a pair of red dwarfs in the process of merging or a star and white dwarf, all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. Luminous red novae share the name and are also cataclysmic variables, but are a different type of event caused by a stellar merger. Also with similar names are the much more energetic supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae.",

    "Summary": "You want to know why I perform as a stage magician? Why my father did before me? Here's the real trick, Bruce. The secret behind it all. The more you let magic consume your life, the less connected to the real world you become. You become a ghost of yourself. You become less and less of a person. It just eats away at you, Bruce. Every day, the knowledge consumes you. Suddenly, you know that none of the laws of nature really matter. You can change all of it with a few backwards words. YTIVARG ON EROM. THGIN SEMOCEB YAD. NIAR SEMOCEB SREWOLF. And then you can put it all right back. KCAB OT LAMRON. Do you know how hard it is to talk to someone in the real world when you know that, Bruce? How hard it is to anchor yourself to the real? So maybe you force it. You keep a schedule, make yourself deal with the real people, day in, day out, so you don't forget their perspective matters as much as your own. So you stay something like a human.",

Her mere presence warps the arcane mathematics governing realities, sometimes causing cataclysms without conscious effort or malice. This perhaps explains the breezy nonchalance with which Zoe approaches her duties, giving her plenty of time to focus on playing games, tricking mortals, or otherwise amusing herself. An encounter with Zoe can be joyous and life affirming, but it is always more than it appears and often extremely dangerous.",

However, this plush toy possesses power rivaling that of Monzaemon at its limits and the defensive power of an impregnable fortress, so ordinary Digimon and the like are completely unable to oppose it. However, like Monzaemon, if nothing is pulling its strings, then it is nothing but an ornament.",

Its armor is the hardest among all of the Deva's equipment, and once it gets inside of the armor, it is absolutely protected. During battle, it is occasionally possible to cut through the breach when it rolls around in that state.",

Darkness. Suffocating spaces. It's because the past is buried. And I'm swept up in the pursuit of it like a sparrow in a gale. Driven by the twin compulsions of my existence.

With Garet at his side, Isaac travels across the world of Weyard to save Jenna, and stop the evil Mars Adepts from activating the forbidden power of Alchemy.

In Justice League No. 2, Batman notes that he and Superman have at least one thing in common: both of them speak openly of their distaste for Luthor. In the New 52 Action Comics (a series set some time before the events of Justice League #1), Luthor is hired by General Sam Lane to capture Superman by setting a train accident as a trap for him. The younger Superman, who is weaker and inexperienced, barely stops the train and is left unconscious. Lex collects Superman and subjects him to a series of tests to ascertain his strengths and weaknesses. He tortures Superman until the latter manages to escape. Lex is later revealed to have obtained contact with the \"Collector of Worlds\" through unknown means and was told to say the word \"Krypton\" to Superman. He later appears when the Collector abducts New Troy as one of the residents in the area. He along with Lois and Jimmy go into Glen Glenmorgan's hotel where Lex calls the Collector and it is revealed that Lex had made a deal with him. It is later revealed that Lex Luthor was the secret caller named \"Icarus\" that was giving secret information on Glen Glenmorgan to Clark Kent.",

As a follower of the Four Holy Beasts Digimon Baihumon, it has a curious disposition of not speaking and not showing its emotions on its face. However, contrasted with its facial expressions, its body movements are overflowing and its emotions are expressed through its bodily poses. Those suggest that it is often in a more or less good mood, but that its overflowing curiosity doesn't last very long. It makes a hobby out of collecting and locking up the things that catch its eye in its Bǎo Yù, and in battle, it is a pacifist that locks up the opponent to settle its issues.",

However, despite Malekith's best efforts, the Dark Elves were again defeated by Thor and his companions.",

Once the greatest warrior in all the Nine Realms, over the centuries he learned how to appreciate peace, eventually banishing his own daughter to Hel when she attempted to subjugate the entire universe.

When Thor returned and saved the Frost Giants from extinction at the hands of Loki, who seemingly lost his life during the conflict, Odin realized that Thor had proven that he would be worthy enough to take the throne of Asgard one day.",

    "Summary": "A computer virus infected the databanks of a laboratory where the investigations and excavations of ancient life forms is performed, and took in the data of an ancient life form and evolved. It became like the life form which in ancient times was the apex of the food chain, which had a great appetite and supplied it with an ability capable of allowing it to see food that was of the finest quality. Skillfully using the tentacles that grow from its head, it catches the enemy and kills them with the sharp blade that grows from its tail. When the progression of a fight becomes disadvantageous, it uses its sharp tentacles to hoist up the soil of the seabed to hide its body. The radar eye that projects from its head captures the enemy like a night vision scope, watching for the chance to create a turnabout.",

Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flare-up that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. All observed novae involve closely located binary stars (the progenitors) - either a pair of red dwarfs in the process of merging or a star and white dwarf, all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. Luminous red novae share the name and are also cataclysmic variables, but are a different type of event caused by a stellar merger. Also with similar names are the much more energetic supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae.",

For the satyrs of the Skola Valley on Theros, pleasure, revelry, and mischief are virtues of the highest regard. Xenagos is the epitome of these ideals. While he does not rule the satyrs, Xenagos savors his role as de facto revelry host. When his Planeswalker spark ignited, he was excited to bring his boisterous, carefree hedonism to distant planes. His goal was to discover all the pleasures of the Multiverse...but what he found instead was disillusionment. On Theros, his gods were real, but elsewhere, they held no influence. This began to gnaw at Xenagos, who ultimately returned to his home plane. While he tried to throw himself back into the revelries, they no longer gave him the same level of amusement. The natural order of things on Theros had become a farce to Xenagos, and he refused to play the fool. Where once Xenagos lived only for the moment, his newfound awareness of the Multiverse had ruined his ability to lose himself in the bedlam of satyr festivities. However, he refuses to succumb to listlessness, and just as he has been known to push revelries a few steps too far, Xenagos is now working a plan to elevate himself from mortal to god.",

Three years later, he traveled up to Mt. Aleph, where the source of Alchemy resides with his friends and Mr. Kraden. While exploring the mountain, they come across an ancient room where the 4 elemental stars reside. Saturos, Menardi, and Jenna's supposedly deceased brother Felix followed them to the mountain, forcing them to hand over the elemental stars with the exception of the Mars Star. With Garet at his side, Isaac travels across the world of Weyard to save Jenna, and stop the evil Mars Adepts from activating the forbidden power of Alchemy.

Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flare-up that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. All observed novae involve closely located binary stars (the progenitors) - either a pair of red dwarfs in the process of merging or a star and white dwarf, all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. Luminous red novae share the name and are also cataclysmic variables, but are a different type of event caused by a stellar merger. Also with similar names are the much more energetic supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae.",

In Makai there is a distortion in space called the Gate, which connects that world to Earth. The Gate is full of energy and swallows everyone who comes near it, which is why it was sealed by the nobles. Ozom decided to convince Jedah to use the energy of the Gate and gain even more power and was then tasked to break only a few seals, to safely maintain the energy output. Instead, Ozom shattered all of them, making it so that when Jedah tried to absorb all the energy bursting out of the gate, it proved too much for him, destroying his body. Ozom's plan had succeeded, and he gathered the remaining power left by the explosion and took over Jedah's estate and his land, becoming the leader of the Dohma family and proclaiming himself emperor. Years later, he resurrected Lord Raptor with the purpose of using him to get rid of the Darkstalkers on Earth and extend his dominion over the planet through his new servant. What Ozom didn't expect was Jedah's resilience, which allowed him to come back from apparent death 100 years later. Jedah returned to his castle, easily removed Ozom and used his soul to create the Majigen, a dimension hosting his plan for the salvation of Makai.",

Once a noble and good-natured child (if somewhat jealous of his brother), he was bitten by the Great Devourer, an ancient snake mutated by the power of The Overlord. The venom of the Great Devourer began to change his personality, slowly making him into an evil and cruel person. Though this was at first imperceptible, the evil in his veins slowly began to manifest. Garmadon then became the student of the evil cultist Master Chen, who granted him the title of lordship. Chen also encouraged him to pursue a young Misako, who his brother was also wooing, by stealing a letter from Wu and claiming it to be his. After Chen's manipulation of the Serpentine and Ninjago's citizens led to war between the two factions, Garmadon rejoined his brother and the Elemental Masters, ultimately defeating the Serpentine and forcing them underground.",

Afterward, he was ridden of his powers and forced to work in Chen's noodle factory. Eventually, Gravis united with the other Elemental Masters to reclaim their elements. Gravis and the Elemental Masters united against Master Chen, who completed a spell that transformed him and his followers into fake Anacondrai. Consequently, an ancient conflict was renewed, as the new alliance of Elemental Masters fought Chen's army at the Corridor of Elders before Garmadon sacrificed himself in a bid to banish their adversaries to the Cursed Realm. Months after the war's end, Nadakhan imprisoned Gravis in the Djinn Blade, but after Jay made his final wish, these events were erased and he was freed. It's unknown where Gravis was during Lord Garmadon's rule, due to his absence in the Resistance.",

As the tournament progressed, Turner proved to be a worthy competitor, and eventually became an ally of the ninja as Chen revealed his true intentions and stole everyone's elements. After reclaiming their powers, the Elemental Masters united against Chen, who completed a spell that transformed him and his followers into fake Anacondrai. Turner and his allies rallied the people of Ninjago to fight Chen's followers at the Corridor of Elders. Despite their best efforts, they were overpowered until Garmadon sacrificed himself to curse Chen's army. Months later, Nadakhan imprisoned Turner in the Djinn Blade, though after Jay made his final wish, recent events were erased and he was freed. After the supposed demise of the original ninja, Turner and many others would form a new team under Lloyd in a bid to resist Lord Garmadon's oppressive rule. Griffin was captured by Garmadon's forces and broke free after receiving word of the ninja's return. He helped in defeating the Colossus and watched as Ninjago was freed from the Sons of Garmadon's leadership.",

After he became king, he went on a quest to find the Storm Amulet for his main goal. Once he did, he was able to reawaken Wojira and take control of her with his trident. However, during his assault on Ninjago City, Kalmaar was ultimately devoured by Wojira after Benthomaar destroyed his trident, which resulted in him losing control of the giant sea serpent.",

Though this was at first imperceptible, the evil in his veins slowly began to manifest. Garmadon then became the student of the evil cultist Master Chen, who granted him the title of lordship. Chen also encouraged him to pursue a young Misako, who his brother was also wooing, by stealing a letter from Wu and claiming it to be his. After Chen's manipulation of the Serpentine and Ninjago's citizens led to war between the two factions, Garmadon rejoined his brother and the Elemental Masters, ultimately defeating the Serpentine and forcing them underground.",

    "Summary": "Once a young boy in Ninjago, Master Chen was a less than talented individual, always told he would amount to nothing and was constantly compared to the far more talented Elemental Masters. Growing angry at this, Chen grew to resent the Elemental Masters. Chen eventually became a Master and trained a young Lord Garmadon and the dark sorcerer Clouse. Becoming bored with Ninjago’s peace, Chen took advantage of tensions with the Serpentine populace, who were already despised due to their predictions of doom over the prophecy of the foretold Golden Master who would enslave all of humanity, and due to their advice of underground civilization to escape his wrath. Spreading lies of a plan to break the peace treaty using his resources, Chen instigated The First Serpentine War, and sided with the Serpentine. Though the Serpentine were easily pushed back by the Elemental Masters, the tables turned during the appearance of the Anacondrai, who were stronger and faster than any Elemental Master. However, Garmadon turned on Chen, and joined his brother Wu to help force back the Anacondrai. Though at first successful, Chen once again used his skills with manipulation to turn the Elemental Masters against each other. However, Garmadon devised a way to easily push back the horde of Serpentine, in the form of the Sacred Flute. The Serpentine, as a last resort, unleashed The Great Devourer, a giant snake mutated by The Overlord’s evil, but found it no more immune to the flute then they were. As a result, the Serpentine were sealed underground, with the Anacondrai being forced to consume each other to near extinction for food, the Great Devourer sealed under the Serpentine city Ouroboros, and the Anacondrai generals being given the maximum sentence, The Cursed Realm. Chen was exiled to his island, and the Masters were reunited against the now rogue time twins. However, Chen was unfazed, and used his resources to gain followers, creating a cult around the Anacondrai, creating the Staff of Elements for a ritual to transform him and his followers into Anacondrai Warriors. Sending his followers to create a prolific business in the form of “Mr. Chen’s Noodle House,” Chen became rich and lived a lavish life on his island, marrying the Elemental Master of Amber and having a a child with her. Eventually, after the defeat of the Golden Master, Chen paid the bounty hunter Ronin to capture a reconstructed Zane, using him as leverage to force the ninja, who had believed Zane dead, to participate in the Tournament of Elements. Playing the Elemental Masters against each other, Chen successfully stole all of the Elemntal Abilities necessary for the ritual, but was thwarted by Kai and Skylor, who turned on him and destroyed his staff. However, Chen managed to capture Skylor and used her copies abilities as fuel for the ritual instead. Ultimately overpowering the Masters, his cult was defeated when Garmadon sacrificed himself to unseal the souls of the Anacondrai Generals in the Cursed Realm, who then cursed the cult, allowing The Preeminent to devour their souls.",

    "Summary": "Morro is one of the major villains in Season 5 of Ninjago. He was a direct descendant of the original Elemental Master of Wind, and was found by Sensei Wu: noticing his powers, the latter trained him hoping that he would have become the Green Ninja, however because of this, Morro became arrogant and full of himself, and even violent against Wu's other disciples. When he was put to test by the Golden Weapons to see if he was indeed destined to become the Green Ninja, it was revealed that he wasn't the chosen one, and because of this he got angry and tried to prove destiny wrong, but always failed, and afterwards left Sensei Wu's Monastery. Eventually, he died, and his soul was sent to the Cursed Realm and turned into a Ghost Warrior by The Preeminent. 40 years later, after Chen and his army were banished in the Cursed Realm by Lloyd, the Preeminent didn't miss this occasion and sent Morro to Ninjago to find the Realm Crystal, necessary to unleash her and let her curse every other realm. However, Morro was jealous of Lloyd for having become the Green Ninja, and he decided to possess him for the majority of his quest, nullifying the powers of the other 4 Ninja as a consequence.",

After the Ninjas escaped from New Ninjago City, the Digital Overlord used Zane's project to build an entire army of Zane-like Nindroids, but these new robots were designed to be much stronger and more powerful than the White Ninja, and were capable, like the rest of the Digital Monster's technology, of absorbing Golden Power to become more powerful. With the help of the Nindroid army, under the command of General Cryptor, and also thanks to Pythor, the Overlord would have later achieved the powers of the Golden Ninja to become the legendary Golden Master.",

Many years later, his brother left to train under Master Chen, leaving the duty to him alone. Eventually, Wu met a young Morro, whom he found digging through his trash for food, and took pity on him, taking him in and training him in the Way of the. Ninja. Eventually, he found out that Morro was in actuality a descendant of the Master of Wind and believed him to be the foretold Green Ninja. However, this theory was found to be false when The Golden Weapons failed to react to Morro, who left the Monastery in anger and vowed to find The Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master, eventually suffocating to death in poison gas and becoming conscripted to The Cursed Realm for his crimes. Soon, however, Wu, found himself embroiled in The First Serpentine War, and alongside his brother and The Elemental Alliance, fought the Serpentine and defeated them using the sacred flute. Soon after, however, the Alliance and Wu were betrayed by the Masters of Time Krux and Acronix, who believed their power over the Element of Time made them superior to the other Elemental Masters. After being soundly defeated by the two, the group turned to the Masters of Water and Fire, Maya and Ray, who forged four blades of Chronosteel to absorb, and hold their power. As punishment, the Time Blades, as well as Krux and Acronix were scattered throughout time. Sometime after, Wu found himself facing his brother, whose corruption had finally fully manifested itself, over the weapons of their father, before accidentally killing him and sealing him in the underworld. In order to safeguard the Four Weapons, Wu hid the weapons in remote places and placed a dragon to guard each and gave the map to Ray and Maya. Many years later, Wu recruited the 4 ninja to help him protect the weapons against Garmadon’s army of Skulkin warriors, teaching them in the ways of Spinjitzu. Eventually, his nephew Lloyd and Kai’s Sister Nya joined the ranks of the ninja, who became Ninjago’s greatest heroes. Eventually, during a battle against the returned Krux and Acronix, Wu was lost in time, and was later found by the Sons of Garmadon, having been reverted to his infancy. Soon after, he was lost in The First Realm along with his students, and eventually regained his adulthood. Finding the legendary Dragon Armor, worn by his father in his youth, he gained the respect of The Firstbourne, and travelled back along with the ninja to fight the newly resurrected Garmadon.",

Having evolved into the dominant lifeforms on their planet following the extinction of a human-like species that existed before them, the Nebulans were forced to seek out a new home planet as the lasting pollution left behind by their predecessors rendered their world uninhabitable. The Nebulans discovered Earth, a planet similar to their own inhabited by a species much like their predecessors who were in the process of destroying the planet through industrial pollution. Planning to save the Earth from humanity and establish a new peaceful utopia for their kind, a Nebulan invasion force posed as a charitable organization constructing the World Children's Land theme park, using the park's Godzilla Tower attraction as a staging ground for their invasion. The Nebulans summoned their own cybernetic monster creation, Gigan, along with the dreaded King Ghidorah to eradicate human civilization. A group of humans who were privy to the conspiracy foiled the Nebulans and destroyed their base of operations, while Godzilla and Anguirus drove off the space monsters. A year later, the Seatopians, themselves in the process of launching an invasion of the surface world with their own monster Megalon, contacted the Nebulans and asked for Gigan's assistance. The Nebulans obliged and sent Gigan to assist in the invasion, but both he and Megalon were repelled by Godzilla and Jet Jaguar.",

    "Summary": "The Golden Weapons were four weapons forged by The First Spinjitzu Master as a child in order to create his own world after his escape from The Realm of The Oni and the Dragon. The four weapons each contain the immense power of the four basic elements, and when used together can manipulate the Elemental Essence of Creation, which allows the user to create something out of nothing, and manipulate the four main elements and the secondary elements that make up the world. After their retrieval from their hiding places by the ninja, they were stolen by Lord Garmadon and reforged into the immensely powerful Mega Weapon, which sacrificed its destructive capabilities to grant the user wishes and power over reality. After being shot into space following Garmadon's plan to go back in time and change the past, both the past and present sets of weapons were forged into The Golden Armor by The Overlord in order to fuel the missing 1% of golden power necessary to become The Golden Master. After The Overlord's defeat, The Golden Armor was hidden by Cyrus Borg in Hiroshi's Labyrinth for safekeeping. However, after the assault on Ninjago by The Oni, they were reforged into the Golden Weapons by Kai, but were depowered after the ninjas including Wu and Garmadon used the Tornado of Creation. They were later taken by the Cystal Council and turned into the '''Weapons of Destruction''' by Aspheera, they were later reclaimed by the ninja and turned back into their original state as pure elemental energy becoming the Golden Ultra Dragon.",

    "Summary": "In the First Realm, only two races existed, the Oni, and the Dragons, beings who controlled creation and destruction, and who fought each other in an eternal stalemate. One day, however, a child who was born of both the Oni and the Dragon was born. This child, known as the First Spinjitzu Master, was sought by both races as a means to end the war. Seeing that the two races would never find peace and couldn't understand the balance that was necessary for existence, left the realm to create his own, which became known as Ninjago. However, as the balance dictates that a world must have both good and evil, the Overlord - the dark spirit that had always existed - emerged into the Realm. The First Spinjitzu Master and the Overlord fought tirelessly and endlessly until The Overlord created a stone army to finally kill him. Knowing that he would eventually lose, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land in two, the Overlord being sealed into The Dark Island. However, the Overlord saw the arrival of Lord Garmadon, and thus waited for the ultimate battle between good and evil. Eventually, his prediction came to pass, with Lord Garmadon being betrayed by the Serpentine and left to rot in the ocean, eventually landing on the island. Manipulating Lord Garmadon and starting the Celestial Clock's countdown, which would dictate the beginning of the battle, The Overlord tricked him into spreading darkness through the Garmatron into Ninjago, shifting the balance back to darkness and restoring his powers. Forcibly taking over Garmadon's body and regaining his true form, and proceeded to corrupt all of Ninjago. However, he was ultimately soundly defeated by Lloyd Garmadon, who had become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master and was purged from Ninjago. Unfortunately for the Ninjas, the site of his defeat was still a foothold for him to remain and allowed him to take over Borg Industries, whose headquarters were built upon it. Taking over New Ninjago City’s infrastructure and the entirety of their computer system, he began a campaign to drain Lloyd’s power in order to become the Golden Master, a legendary being of Serpentine lore who held the powers of The First Spinjitzu Master at his peak, and would be fated to enslave the world. Eventually fulfilling this role with the power of the Golden Weapons, the Overlord was defeated by Zane, who sacrificed himself to turn the Overlord’s power against himself at the cost of his own life, purging his darkness from Ninjago once more.",

To defeat the First Spinjitzu Master, The Overlord decided to use refined Dark Matter to create an army of indestructible warriors, that could be controlled only with a special item: the Helmet of Shadows. Once they fought the Creator of Ninjago, the latter was completely overwhelmed, as the Warriors were completely indestructible and immune to his powers, but he managed to create an Elemental Blade, which negated their invulnerability and immunity. Despite this, the Overlord and his servants were still too much for the First Spinjitzu Master to handle, as they pushed him to split Ninjago in half, sealing the Overlord in one of the new two continents, which became the Island of Darkness, and banishing the remaining Warriors of the Stone Army in a prison underground. Thousands of years later, the Stone Army was reawakened by the Great Devourer's poison and escaped their prison, and after going on a rampage on Ninjago, they forced the Ninja to retreat and to go to the Temple of Light to find the other Elemental Blades to regain their powers and to defeat both the Army and the Overlord, which came to power again thanks to Lord Garmadon.",

However, this plan failed, and he accidentally cursed the entire Temple he was in, making him and all of his students become undead ghosts bound forever in the temple. Later, the Yin Blade was encased in a case of Clearstone and brought to the Ninjago Museum of History. There, Cole, during the Day of the Departed, wanting to free himself from the curse cast by Sensei Yang, took the blade to and went to the latter's temple to fight him, but he was ambushed and captured by his students. Yang then, taking advantage of the ongoing Yin-Yang Eclypse, used the Yin Blade to open a rift to the Departed Realm and to come back to life, however, once Cole freed himself, he was defeated after a brief battle, and the Yin Blade was completely destroyed by Cole in his new RX form.",

Originally a creation of his father, Dr. Julien, Zane was an android (later dubbed a Nindroid due to his status as one of the ninjas) designed to help others who were weaker than himself. However, one day, he and his father were visited by the previous Master of Ice, who bestowed upon him his power, giving him an incredible power source to serve as his heart[1]. Eventually, his father died and erased his memory to spare him the pain. Zane was then found by Sensei Wu and was made part of the ninja. Eventually learning of his origin during the Second Serpentine War[2] and reuniting with his father, who had been resurrected by the King of the Underworld[3], he unlocked his true potential[2] and eventually sacrificed himself to destroy The Golden Master[4]. However, his spirit lived on[4] and recreated his body in the form of The Titanium Ninja, stronger than ever before.",

From his attack, mankind found and harnessed G-Energy, an energy source taken from Godzilla. 60 years later, Godzilla appears again to feed on the G-Energy. Godzilla progresses through Japan, fighting off Kaiju that are seemingly attracted to him and destroying G-Generators. Mankind takes information on Godzilla, and it is revealed that since Godzilla's first attack, G-Force has been constructing a Godzilla-like robot. Once all the data on Godzilla is collected, the robot is deployed. This can either be Super Mechagodzilla or Kiryu depending on the player's difficulty. Godzilla defeats the robot and destroys the last two generators. Godzilla then appears to be returning to the sea, however, the energy he absorbs causes him to enter critical mass and become Burning Godzilla. It is theorized that he will explode and destroy the world. The G-Force Operator suggests freezing him, and freeze tanks are sent out. The Super X3 arrives but is damaged. Soon after, what appears to be another Godzilla appears, but is also defeated. The Gotengo and Super X3 manage to freeze Godzilla, and Kiryu carries him out to sea. They both sink into the ocean, and humanity begins to rebuild.",

    "Summary": "Gravis is the current Elemental Master of Gravity and was a competitor in Master Chen's Tournament of Elements, alongside the other Elemental Masters of his generation. In the second round of the event, Gravis fought against Griffin Turner, who used his element to claim the Jadeblade, beating Gravis. Afterward, he was ridden of his powers and forced to work in Chen's noodle factory. Eventually, Gravis united with the other Elemental Masters to reclaim their elements. Gravis and the Elemental Masters united against Master Chen, who completed a spell that transformed him and his followers into fake Anacondrai. Consequently, an ancient conflict was renewed, as the new alliance of Elemental Masters fought Chen's army at the Corridor of Elders before Garmadon sacrificed himself in a bid to banish their adversaries to the Cursed Realm. Months after the war's end, Nadakhan imprisoned Gravis in the Djinn Blade, but after Jay made his final wish, these events were erased and he was freed. It's unknown where Gravis was during Lord Garmadon's rule, due to his absence in the Resistance.",

As the tournament progressed, Turner proved to be a worthy competitor, and eventually became an ally of the ninja as Chen revealed his true intentions and stole everyone's elements. After reclaiming their powers, the Elemental Masters united against Chen, who completed a spell that transformed him and his followers into fake Anacondrai. Turner and his allies rallied the people of Ninjago to fight Chen's followers at the Corridor of Elders. Despite their best efforts, they were overpowered until Garmadon sacrificed himself to curse Chen's army. Months later, Nadakhan imprisoned Turner in the Djinn Blade, though after Jay made his final wish, recent events were erased and he was freed. After the supposed demise of the original ninja, Turner and many others would form a new team under Lloyd in a bid to resist Lord Garmadon's oppressive rule. Griffin was captured by Garmadon's forces and broke free after receiving word of the ninja's return. He helped in defeating the Colossus and watched as Ninjago was freed from the Sons of Garmadon's leadership.",

The venom of the Great Devourer began to change his personality, slowly making him into an evil and cruel person. Though this was at first imperceptible, the evil in his veins slowly began to manifest. Garmadon then became the student of the evil cultist Master Chen, who granted him the title of lordship. Chen also encouraged him to pursue a young Misako, who his brother was also wooing, by stealing a letter from Wu and claiming it to be his. After Chen's manipulation of the Serpentine and Ninjago's citizens led to war between the two factions, Garmadon rejoined his brother and the Elemental Masters, ultimately defeating the Serpentine and forcing them underground.",

Despite being a capable commander and a highly professional warrior, he has failed to stop Arin, Sora, and Lloyd from freeing and escaping with the dragons Imperium had captured. Consequently, Ras was stripped of his title as leader of the Claws and imprisoned for his failures by Empress Beatrix, who now decided to do the job herself. During the MergeQuake Storm, Ras managed to escape his cell and, in the aftermath, recruited Jordana for her achievement in extracting energy from a Source Dragon on behalf of his master. A year after the Liberation of Imperium Lord Ras traversed the Forest of Spirits with Jordana and used the Source Dragon energy to open the Shadow Dojo. He reassembled the Wolf Clan and then attacked the Cloud Kingdom and the Land of Lost Things, seeking to free the Forbidden Five during the Ritual of the Blood Moon, but only succeeded in releasing Nokt after sending Kai to the Nether-Space. After that he promised his master that he would not fail him again.",

    "Summary": "Once a young boy in Ninjago, Master Chen was a less than talented individual, always told he would amount to nothing and was constantly compared to the far more talented Elemental Masters. Growing angry at this, Chen grew to resent the Elemental Masters. Chen eventually became a Master and trained a young Lord Garmadon and the dark sorcerer Clouse. Becoming bored with Ninjago’s peace, Chen took advantage of tensions with the Serpentine populace, who were already despised due to their predictions of doom over the prophecy of the foretold Golden Master who would enslave all of humanity, and due to their advice of underground civilization to escape his wrath. Spreading lies of a plan to break the peace treaty using his resources, Chen instigated The First Serpentine War, and sided with the Serpentine. Though the Serpentine were easily pushed back by the Elemental Masters, the tables turned during the appearance of the Anacondrai, who were stronger and faster than any Elemental Master. However, Garmadon turned on Chen, and joined his brother Wu to help force back the Anacondrai. Though at first successful, Chen once again used his skills with manipulation to turn the Elemental Masters against each other. However, Garmadon devised a way to easily push back the horde of Serpentine, in the form of the Sacred Flute. The Serpentine, as a last resort, unleashed The Great Devourer, a giant snake mutated by The Overlord’s evil, but found it no more immune to the flute then they were. As a result, the Serpentine were sealed underground, with the Anacondrai being forced to consume each other to near extinction for food, the Great Devourer sealed under the Serpentine city Ouroboros, and the Anacondrai generals being given the maximum sentence, The Cursed Realm. Chen was exiled to his island, and the Masters were reunited against the now rogue time twins. However, Chen was unfazed, and used his resources to gain followers, creating a cult around the Anacondrai, creating the Staff of Elements for a ritual to transform him and his followers into Anacondrai Warriors. Sending his followers to create a prolific business in the form of “Mr. Chen’s Noodle House,” Chen became rich and lived a lavish life on his island, marrying the Elemental Master of Amber and having a a child with her. Eventually, after the defeat of the Golden Master, Chen paid the bounty hunter Ronin to capture a reconstructed Zane, using him as leverage to force the ninja, who had believed Zane dead, to participate in the Tournament of Elements. Playing the Elemental Masters against each other, Chen successfully stole all of the Elemntal Abilities necessary for the ritual, but was thwarted by Kai and Skylor, who turned on him and destroyed his staff. However, Chen managed to capture Skylor and used her copies abilities as fuel for the ritual instead. Ultimately overpowering the Masters, his cult was defeated when Garmadon sacrificed himself to unseal the souls of the Anacondrai Generals in the Cursed Realm, who then cursed the cult, allowing The Preeminent to devour their souls.",

    "Summary": "The Nindroids are the main villain faction that faced the Ninjas in the 3rd season of Ninjago. After the Overlord was defeated by Lloyd, a small part of his spirit remained stuck in the Borg Tower and managed to enter in all of its computers in the form of a virus, eventually expanding and taking over the entire city. After the Ninjas escaped from New Ninjago City, the Digital Overlord used Zane's project to build an entire army of Zane-like Nindroids, but these new robots were designed to be much stronger and more powerful than the White Ninja, and were capable, like the rest of the Digital Monster's technology, of absorbing Golden Power to become more powerful. With the help of the Nindroid army, under the command of General Cryptor, and also thanks to Pythor, the Overlord would have later achieved the powers of the Golden Ninja to become the legendary Golden Master.",

However, Ozom desired to take Jedah's place as one of the three high nobles of Makai, and set up a plan to usurp his throne. In Makai there is a distortion in space called the Gate, which connects that world to Earth. The Gate is full of energy and swallows everyone who comes near it, which is why it was sealed by the nobles. Ozom decided to convince Jedah to use the energy of the Gate and gain even more power and was then tasked to break only a few seals, to safely maintain the energy output. Instead, Ozom shattered all of them, making it so that when Jedah tried to absorb all the energy bursting out of the gate, it proved too much for him, destroying his body. Ozom's plan had succeeded, and he gathered the remaining power left by the explosion and took over Jedah's estate and his land, becoming the leader of the Dohma family and proclaiming himself emperor. Years later, he resurrected Lord Raptor with the purpose of using him to get rid of the Darkstalkers on Earth and extend his dominion over the planet through his new servant. What Ozom didn't expect was Jedah's resilience, which allowed him to come back from apparent death 100 years later. Jedah returned to his castle, easily removed Ozom and used his soul to create the Majigen, a dimension hosting his plan for the salvation of Makai.",

The two inherited the powers of the Oni and the Dragon and trained under his father in the ways of Spinjitzu. After the corruption of Garmadon by the venom of The Great Devourer, Wu found himself more distant from his brother, though still on friendly terms, and along with his brother, took it upon himself to protect and safeguard The Golden Weapons after the death of his father. Many years later, his brother left to train under Master Chen, leaving the duty to him alone. Eventually, Wu met a young Morro, whom he found digging through his trash for food, and took pity on him, taking him in and training him in the Way of the. Ninja. Eventually, he found out that Morro was in actuality a descendant of the Master of Wind and believed him to be the foretold Green Ninja. However, this theory was found to be false when The Golden Weapons failed to react to Morro, who left the Monastery in anger and vowed to find The Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master, eventually suffocating to death in poison gas and becoming conscripted to The Cursed Realm for his crimes. Soon, however, Wu, found himself embroiled in The First Serpentine War, and alongside his brother and The Elemental Alliance, fought the Serpentine and defeated them using the sacred flute. Soon after, however, the Alliance and Wu were betrayed by the Masters of Time Krux and Acronix, who believed their power over the Element of Time made them superior to the other Elemental Masters. After being soundly defeated by the two, the group turned to the Masters of Water and Fire, Maya and Ray, who forged four blades of Chronosteel to absorb, and hold their power. As punishment, the Time Blades, as well as Krux and Acronix were scattered throughout time. Sometime after, Wu found himself facing his brother, whose corruption had finally fully manifested itself, over the weapons of their father, before accidentally killing him and sealing him in the underworld. In order to safeguard the Four Weapons, Wu hid the weapons in remote places and placed a dragon to guard each and gave the map to Ray and Maya. Many years later, Wu recruited the 4 ninja to help him protect the weapons against Garmadon’s army of Skulkin warriors, teaching them in the ways of Spinjitzu. Eventually, his nephew Lloyd and Kai’s Sister Nya joined the ranks of the ninja, who became Ninjago’s greatest heroes. Eventually, during a battle against the returned Krux and Acronix, Wu was lost in time, and was later found by the Sons of Garmadon, having been reverted to his infancy. Soon after, he was lost in The First Realm along with his students, and eventually regained his adulthood. Finding the legendary Dragon Armor, worn by his father in his youth, he gained the respect of The Firstbourne, and travelled back along with the ninja to fight the newly resurrected Garmadon.",

Insect-like aliens resembling gigantic upright cockroaches, the Nebulans hail from an unnamed homeworld located within the M Space Hunter Nebula. Having evolved into the dominant lifeforms on their planet following the extinction of a human-like species that existed before them, the Nebulans were forced to seek out a new home planet as the lasting pollution left behind by their predecessors rendered their world uninhabitable. The Nebulans discovered Earth, a planet similar to their own inhabited by a species much like their predecessors who were in the process of destroying the planet through industrial pollution. Planning to save the Earth from humanity and establish a new peaceful utopia for their kind, a Nebulan invasion force posed as a charitable organization constructing the World Children's Land theme park, using the park's Godzilla Tower attraction as a staging ground for their invasion. The Nebulans summoned their own cybernetic monster creation, Gigan, along with the dreaded King Ghidorah to eradicate human civilization. A group of humans who were privy to the conspiracy foiled the Nebulans and destroyed their base of operations, while Godzilla and Anguirus drove off the space monsters. A year later, the Seatopians, themselves in the process of launching an invasion of the surface world with their own monster Megalon, contacted the Nebulans and asked for Gigan's assistance. The Nebulans obliged and sent Gigan to assist in the invasion, but both he and Megalon were repelled by Godzilla and Jet Jaguar.",

However, she eventually forged a friendship with The First Spinjitzu Master, who was a child between both races and helped him seek peace between them. To this end, the two forged the Dragon Armor, a symbol of respect and a powerful weapon. However, many saw The First Spinjitzu Master as only a means to be victorious in the war. Seeing that peace would be impossible, The First Spinjitzu Master left the realm and created his own realm, Ninjago. Guarding his armor, The Firstbourne awaited the day that he would return to the First Realm.",

The four weapons each contain the immense power of the four basic elements, and when used together can manipulate the Elemental Essence of Creation, which allows the user to create something out of nothing, and manipulate the four main elements and the secondary elements that make up the world. After their retrieval from their hiding places by the ninja, they were stolen by Lord Garmadon and reforged into the immensely powerful Mega Weapon, which sacrificed its destructive capabilities to grant the user wishes and power over reality. After being shot into space following Garmadon's plan to go back in time and change the past, both the past and present sets of weapons were forged into The Golden Armor by The Overlord in order to fuel the missing 1% of golden power necessary to become The Golden Master. After The Overlord's defeat, The Golden Armor was hidden by Cyrus Borg in Hiroshi's Labyrinth for safekeeping. However, after the assault on Ninjago by The Oni, they were reforged into the Golden Weapons by Kai, but were depowered after the ninjas including Wu and Garmadon used the Tornado of Creation. They were later taken by the Cystal Council and turned into the '''Weapons of Destruction''' by Aspheera, they were later reclaimed by the ninja and turned back into their original state as pure elemental energy becoming the Golden Ultra Dragon.",

    "Summary": "In the First Realm, only two races existed, the Oni, and the Dragons, beings who controlled creation and destruction, and who fought each other in an eternal stalemate. One day, however, a child who was born of both the Oni and the Dragon was born. This child, known as the First Spinjitzu Master, was sought by both races as a means to end the war. Seeing that the two races would never find peace and couldn't understand the balance that was necessary for existence, left the realm to create his own, which became known as Ninjago. However, as the balance dictates that a world must have both good and evil, the Overlord - the dark spirit that had always existed - emerged into the Realm. The First Spinjitzu Master and the Overlord fought tirelessly and endlessly until The Overlord created a stone army to finally kill him. Knowing that he would eventually lose, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land in two, the Overlord being sealed into The Dark Island. However, the Overlord saw the arrival of Lord Garmadon, and thus waited for the ultimate battle between good and evil. Eventually, his prediction came to pass, with Lord Garmadon being betrayed by the Serpentine and left to rot in the ocean, eventually landing on the island. Manipulating Lord Garmadon and starting the Celestial Clock's countdown, which would dictate the beginning of the battle, The Overlord tricked him into spreading darkness through the Garmatron into Ninjago, shifting the balance back to darkness and restoring his powers. Forcibly taking over Garmadon's body and regaining his true form, and proceeded to corrupt all of Ninjago. However, he was ultimately soundly defeated by Lloyd Garmadon, who had become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master and was purged from Ninjago. Unfortunately for the Ninjas, the site of his defeat was still a foothold for him to remain and allowed him to take over Borg Industries, whose headquarters were built upon it. Taking over New Ninjago City’s infrastructure and the entirety of their computer system, he began a campaign to drain Lloyd’s power in order to become the Golden Master, a legendary being of Serpentine lore who held the powers of The First Spinjitzu Master at his peak, and would be fated to enslave the world. Eventually fulfilling this role with the power of the Golden Weapons, the Overlord was defeated by Zane, who sacrificed himself to turn the Overlord’s power against himself at the cost of his own life, purging his darkness from Ninjago once more.",

    "Summary": "The Stone Army is a villain faction that opposed the Ninja in the second season of Ninjago. To defeat the First Spinjitzu Master, The Overlord decided to use refined Dark Matter to create an army of indestructible warriors, that could be controlled only with a special item: the Helmet of Shadows. Once they fought the Creator of Ninjago, the latter was completely overwhelmed, as the Warriors were completely indestructible and immune to his powers, but he managed to create an Elemental Blade, which negated their invulnerability and immunity. Despite this, the Overlord and his servants were still too much for the First Spinjitzu Master to handle, as they pushed him to split Ninjago in half, sealing the Overlord in one of the new two continents, which became the Island of Darkness, and banishing the remaining Warriors of the Stone Army in a prison underground. Thousands of years later, the Stone Army was reawakened by the Great Devourer's poison and escaped their prison, and after going on a rampage on Ninjago, they forced the Ninja to retreat and to go to the Temple of Light to find the other Elemental Blades to regain their powers and to defeat both the Army and the Overlord, which came to power again thanks to Lord Garmadon.",

While its origins are unknown, Sensei Yang discovered it at some point in his life, and after learning that it had Life-Restoring powers, he tried to use it on himself to achieve eternal life. However, this plan failed, and he accidentally cursed the entire Temple he was in, making him and all of his students become undead ghosts bound forever in the temple. Later, the Yin Blade was encased in a case of Clearstone and brought to the Ninjago Museum of History. There, Cole, during the Day of the Departed, wanting to free himself from the curse cast by Sensei Yang, took the blade to and went to the latter's temple to fight him, but he was ambushed and captured by his students. Yang then, taking advantage of the ongoing Yin-Yang Eclypse, used the Yin Blade to open a rift to the Departed Realm and to come back to life, however, once Cole freed himself, he was defeated after a brief battle, and the Yin Blade was completely destroyed by Cole in his new RX form.",

From his attack, mankind found and harnessed G-Energy, an energy source taken from Godzilla. 60 years later, Godzilla appears again to feed on the G-Energy. Godzilla progresses through Japan, fighting off Kaiju that are seemingly attracted to him and destroying G-Generators. Mankind takes information on Godzilla, and it is revealed that since Godzilla's first attack, G-Force has been constructing a Godzilla-like robot. Once all the data on Godzilla is collected, the robot is deployed. This can either be Super Mechagodzilla or Kiryu depending on the player's difficulty. Godzilla defeats the robot and destroys the last two generators. Godzilla then appears to be returning to the sea, however, the energy he absorbs causes him to enter critical mass and become Burning Godzilla. It is theorized that he will explode and destroy the world. The G-Force Operator suggests freezing him, and freeze tanks are sent out. The Super X3 arrives but is damaged. Soon after, what appears to be another Godzilla appears, but is also defeated. The Gotengo and Super X3 manage to freeze Godzilla, and Kiryu carries him out to sea. They both sink into the ocean, and humanity begins to rebuild.",

The four weapons each contain the immense power of the four basic elements, and when used together can manipulate the Elemental Essence of Creation, which allows the user to create something out of nothing, and manipulate the four main elements and the secondary elements that make up the world. After their retrieval from their hiding places by the ninja, they were stolen by Lord Garmadon and reforged into the immensely powerful Mega Weapon, which sacrificed its destructive capabilities to grant the user wishes and power over reality. After being shot into space following Garmadon's plan to go back in time and change the past, both the past and present sets of weapons were forged into The Golden Armor by The Overlord in order to fuel the missing 1% of golden power necessary to become The Golden Master. After The Overlord's defeat, The Golden Armor was hidden by Cyrus Borg in Hiroshi's Labyrinth for safekeeping. However, after the assault on Ninjago by The Oni, they were reforged into the Golden Weapons by Kai, but were depowered after the ninjas including Wu and Garmadon used the Tornado of Creation. They were later taken by the Cystal Council and turned into the '''Weapons of Destruction''' by Aspheera, they were later reclaimed by the ninja and turned back into their original state as pure elemental energy becoming the Golden Ultra Dragon.",
