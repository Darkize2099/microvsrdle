Ikaris learned early on of his true purpose to help initiate the planet's Emergence for the birth of Tiamut, believing Earth to be a necessary sacrifice for more life to be created in new galaxies. In 2023, heralded of Earth's Emergence due to the Blip, Ikaris was forced to betray and murder Ajak when she began opposing Arishem's plan, being inspired by the heroics of the Avengers. Ikaris helped reassemble the other Eternals in preparation for the Emergence, but was singled out when they learned of their true purpose and opposed Arishem's plan as well. When the revelation of Ajak's death came to light and the team became divided whether or not to protect humanity, Ikaris betrayed his friends. He was outmatched by his former allies, who were able to kill Tiamut and effectively avert the Emergence. Guilt-ridden over his actions and having failed to live up to his life's purpose, Ikaris committed suicide by flying headfirst into the Sun.",

    "Summary": "The Hero of Bowerstone, also known as Sparrow, the Hero of Bower Lake, the Hero of the Spire, the Old Hero King/Queen, and many other titles, is the main protagonist in Fable II. The character may be either male or female, by choice of the player at the beginning of the game. a The Hero of Bowerstone is a descendant of The Hero of Oakvale. This is most commonly accepted, as Theresa states in the ruined Chamber of Fate that the Hero of Oakvale was the Hero of Bowerstone's \"forebear\". This is also proven in \"The Hero of Oakvale\", one of the books in Albion, where it speaks of the Hero of Oakvale having a descendant who shall one day save Albion. There is more reason to believe this, with the addition of access to the treasure chest of the Hero of Southcliff, in the Chamber of Fate. Out-of-game lore suggests that only the descendants of the Hero can open the chest.",

It faithfully obeys its sworn brother Skull Knightmon, and battles with faith in him in order to obtain victory. It shows off lightning-speed movements fast enough that they earned it the alias \"Running Lightning\", and its top speed is so fast that it leaves afterimages. However, fine maneuvers are its weak point, so not only are its linear movements easily read by its opponent, it easily collides with obstacles too. However, if you see its sturdy body smashing through obstacles as if they were nothing and continuing to run with a defiant, thunderous roar, you would probably agree that the name \"Running Lightning\" is appropriate for it.",

As a demon beast that was summoned from the Dark Area by the messenger of darkness, Devimon, there are no other Digimon as evil as it is. Although it is a Dramon-species Digimon, its limbs are unusually developed, so it cuts the opponent to pieces with its elongated arms, and flies about the darkness with its sturdy legs and wings. Its personality is the epitome of wickedness, and it is unmoved by a spirit of compassion. If it glares at them with its four eyes burning in deep crimson, the opponent becomes unable to move, and it will chop up their unresisting body. Also, the tip of its tail is able to open up and take on the shape of a claw, which can skewer the opponent. This Digimon was probably produced by the evil feelings of Hackers who were abusing the Computer Network for their own selfish desires",

While they asked each other for their names, she said that her name was just \"Erza.\" Hence, Jellal decided to give her the surname \"Scarlet\" after her scarlet hair so they would never forget it. Eventually, she rebelled against the cult and escaped, but not without losing Jellal, who had been corrupted by Zeref's Dark Arts. She also served as the guild's 7th Guild Master during Makarov's absence in X792.",

He is infamous for his ability to subconsciously strip off his clothing due to the instincts ingrained in him by his teacher's training. Nevertheless, he's a powerful Ice Mage and one of Natsu's main rivals. Gray was from a village up in the North, but the entire village was destroyed by the Demon Deliora. Gray's parents were killed in the incident as well. Along with Ur, a powerful ice Mage, Lyon came investigating Deliora's destruction and found Gray alive among the ruins. Ur took Gray in as her second student and taught him and Lyon Ice-Make Magic. In another encounter with Deliora, his teacher used Iced Shell to seal him away in order to save and protect Gray. After this, Gray took Ur's advice to find strong wizards. This led him to Fairy Tail, where he became a member.",

Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

    "Summary": "Honeybeemon is an Armor-level Insect Digimon that evolved through the power of the \"Digimental of Knowledge\". It moves very quickly due to its tiny body, and its specialty is making sport of the enemy. When it thinks someone is coming at it, it sneaks around behind them in the blink of an eye and they suffer a single blow from its stinger. Because of its small size, its offensive power is weak, but it has speed and techniques that are enough to compensate for this. However, it is extremely fond of sweets, and its weakness is that if they are placed in front of it, it can't see anything else but them.",

Now the Day draws near when we shall avenge ourselves upon those of the day-blasted lands, too, and achieve that ultimate triumph denied us so long ago. While I prepare my Great Revenance, it falls to you to make ready the way. Harry the surface-dwellers, hunt them in their woods and fields, and take the measure of their strength. Do not concern yourself with putting them on their guard; our Lady desires their blood, their fear, and their dreadful anticipation of our ultimate act of revenge. With each slaying we grow in her favor and sow the seeds of our coming victory. If they come against you in Szith Morcane in irresistible strength, slay as many as you can. Withdraw from the fight if you must, and bring Zedarr with you, but as for the rest— they are to stand and die for the glory of the White Banshee. The battle for Szith Morcane will come to nothing when our Great Revenance comes to pass. If anything, our final vengeance is made ever sweeter by each fleeting, false hope our enemies entertain before it falls upon them. Work great slaughter for our Lady’s dark glory, my daughter. Soon I will come to you from Maerimydra with such dark and terrible might that all Faerûn will tremble before us.",

    "Summary": "The Krakens are an ancient, feared, and ferocious race of monsters that have existed since the beginning of time, where they served as warriors to the gods. After the war of the gods ended, they went to the depths of the ocean where they wished to never be bound by beings ever again and bring terror and ferocity on their own end. Whenever a Kraken attacks, nothing can stop it, warships and galleons vanish, ocean trade and communication is destroyed, and entire villages, towns, and cities are destroyed as a side effect if they desire to go onto land to nest. Some are even virtually gods that are worshiped and have cults and minions on land and sea, a Kraken pleased with its worshipers will becalm the sea and bring with it a plentiful amount of fish to the faithful. However, the devious mind of a Kraken is ancient and destructive, ultimately always bent to the devastation of all things.",

It is known to sing an enchanting cry when in a good mood, but in the evenings, it sings plaintively as it seeks what few others of its kind remain. Thankfully, by the time of Sun and Moon, protective regulations have saved the species, so much that there's an overabundance in Alola.",

Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas. It is also one of few pokemon capable of Gigantamaxing.",

He is among the five Dragon Slayers sent to the future from four hundred years past, having an additional purpose in the assistance of the defeat of Acnologia. He was then found by Makarov and was brought to Fairy Tail, where he would become a member.",

Seilah is a calm and collected person who uses story chapter motifs in her speech. She has also displayed a cold and ruthless side to her as shown when she told Elfman that \"mercy doesn't exist in the story of Demons\" while forcing him to strangle Lisanna with her Curse. She is incredibly loyal, if not infatuated with Kyôka, blushing when she was praised for initially believing that she destroyed the mages of Fairy Tail, and referring to her with the honorific -sama. She also has a sense of pride as well as arrogance, shown when she planned to get revenge on Mirajane for ruining her reputation and shaming her in front of Kyôka.",

During his time as head Wyrmspeaker, Severin reformed the cult's core belief systems, turning from the previous fascination with dracoliches to living, breathing dragons. To help with this goal, he sought to summon Tiamat from her prison in Avernus, as well as her temple. In doing so, he forged alliances with several noteworthy organizations- most notably the Red Wizards of Thay, a magical organization he sought to use for the ritual he devised to summon the Dragon Queen.",

For the satyrs of the Skola Valley on Theros, pleasure, revelry, and mischief are virtues of the highest regard. Xenagos is the epitome of these ideals. While he does not rule the satyrs, Xenagos savors his role as de facto revelry host. When his Planeswalker spark ignited, he was excited to bring his boisterous, carefree hedonism to distant planes. His goal was to discover all the pleasures of the Multiverse...but what he found instead was disillusionment. On Theros, his gods were real, but elsewhere, they held no influence. This began to gnaw at Xenagos, who ultimately returned to his home plane. While he tried to throw himself back into the revelries, they no longer gave him the same level of amusement. The natural order of things on Theros had become a farce to Xenagos, and he refused to play the fool. Where once Xenagos lived only for the moment, his newfound awareness of the Multiverse had ruined his ability to lose himself in the bedlam of satyr festivities. However, he refuses to succumb to listlessness, and just as he has been known to push revelries a few steps too far, Xenagos is now working a plan to elevate himself from mortal to god.",

However, being employed by an ordinary Tamer doesn't seem possible.",

In his past, he, Zirconis and a third dragon came across Sonya who they attacked after they deemed she wasn't appetizing enough for them. Acnologia, the one who murdered all the Dragons that participated in the Dragon King Festival, appeared before Animus and his gang and killed the ones that harmed her and left him on the verge of death himself. He later convinced Sonya to allow him to use her body as a container to recover. This eventually led to him befriending the young Sonya, leading the two to sneak in and disrupt the Eclipse Gate ceremony in regards to Anna and Zeref's plan which sent the intertwined two to Stella; thereafter revolutionizing the country which in turn allowed Animus to become the king of Stella and then appointing Sonya to be his aide.",

You need only peer into a demon’s eyes to know evil is not some vacuum waiting for virtue to come and fill its emptiness. Evil is a force. It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable. Understand, there is no redemption, only treason against the side you were born to serve.",

    "Summary": "Deadly Axemon is a younger brother who exchanged cups of brotherhood with SkullKnightmon. It is a brawny fighter replete with nimble movements and physical strength. It faithfully obeys its sworn brother Skull Knightmon, and battles with faith in him in order to obtain victory. It shows off lightning-speed movements fast enough that they earned it the alias \"Running Lightning\", and its top speed is so fast that it leaves afterimages. However, fine maneuvers are its weak point, so not only are its linear movements easily read by its opponent, it easily collides with obstacles too. However, if you see its sturdy body smashing through obstacles as if they were nothing and continuing to run with a defiant, thunderous roar, you would probably agree that the name \"Running Lightning\" is appropriate for it.",

As a demon beast that was summoned from the Dark Area by the messenger of darkness, Devimon, there are no other Digimon as evil as it is. Although it is a Dramon-species Digimon, its limbs are unusually developed, so it cuts the opponent to pieces with its elongated arms, and flies about the darkness with its sturdy legs and wings. Its personality is the epitome of wickedness, and it is unmoved by a spirit of compassion. If it glares at them with its four eyes burning in deep crimson, the opponent becomes unable to move, and it will chop up their unresisting body. Also, the tip of its tail is able to open up and take on the shape of a claw, which can skewer the opponent. This Digimon was probably produced by the evil feelings of Hackers who were abusing the Computer Network for their own selfish desires",

In doing so, he became Doresain the Ghoul King, the first of these despicable types of undead, transformed by the Demon Lord himself. Through this act of consumption, Doresain earned an Abyssal domain populated by countless ghouls, and his avatars spread his reach across the Prime Material Plane and beyond, founding a ghoul kingdom beneath the surface of the world. Eventually, he would acquire a shard of Orcus' power and ascend to Demigodhood.",

Eventually, she rebelled against the cult and escaped, but not without losing Jellal, who had been corrupted by Zeref's Dark Arts.

Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

Gaining her power from Asgard, Hela planned to rule Asgard and create an Asgardian Empire. When all the people of Asgard refused to bow to her, Hela set about massacring Odin's armies and enslaving the people, while recruiting Skurge to be her own Executioner in the process. Eventually, however, Thor returned with the newly formed Revengers and then reengaged Hela, which had then resulted in Loki unleashing Surtur, who then destroyed Asgard by finally causing Ragnarök and killed Hela as a result.",

Ikaris learned early on of his true purpose to help initiate the planet's Emergence for the birth of Tiamut, believing Earth to be a necessary sacrifice for more life to be created in new galaxies. In 2023, heralded of Earth's Emergence due to the Blip, Ikaris was forced to betray and murder Ajak when she began opposing Arishem's plan, being inspired by the heroics of the Avengers. Ikaris helped reassemble the other Eternals in preparation for the Emergence, but was singled out when they learned of their true purpose and opposed Arishem's plan as well. When the revelation of Ajak's death came to light and the team became divided whether or not to protect humanity, Ikaris betrayed his friends. He was outmatched by his former allies, who were able to kill Tiamut and effectively avert the Emergence. Guilt-ridden over his actions and having failed to live up to his life's purpose, Ikaris committed suicide by flying headfirst into the Sun.",

    "Summary": "Our Dark Lady favors my efforts, and my research proceeds well. Within five tendays, perhaps six, all will be ready for the Day of Great Vengeance. The Spider Queen is dead; we have already brought low the Spider-kissers and seized our rightful place in the realms of the dark. Now the Day draws near when we shall avenge ourselves upon those of the day-blasted lands, too, and achieve that ultimate triumph denied us so long ago. While I prepare my Great Revenance, it falls to you to make ready the way. Harry the surface-dwellers, hunt them in their woods and fields, and take the measure of their strength. Do not concern yourself with putting them on their guard; our Lady desires their blood, their fear, and their dreadful anticipation of our ultimate act of revenge. With each slaying we grow in her favor and sow the seeds of our coming victory. If they come against you in Szith Morcane in irresistible strength, slay as many as you can. Withdraw from the fight if you must, and bring Zedarr with you, but as for the rest— they are to stand and die for the glory of the White Banshee. The battle for Szith Morcane will come to nothing when our Great Revenance comes to pass. If anything, our final vengeance is made ever sweeter by each fleeting, false hope our enemies entertain before it falls upon them. Work great slaughter for our Lady’s dark glory, my daughter. Soon I will come to you from Maerimydra with such dark and terrible might that all Faerûn will tremble before us.",

Once this lord passed on control of the land to Iuz, years of endless bloodshed occurred, during which Iuz absorbed and conquered all of his neighbors- he absorbed their souls and ascended to the rank of Demigod. His empire spread like wildfire through the use of infernal demonic armies, orcish tribes, insane cults of wizards, and mercenaries. This all came to a sudden stop when Iuz suddenly disappeared- his worshippers believed he had become a true god, and began to cast holy spells in his name.",

It is also revealed that he had come with the Queen of Blades and the Knight of Blades, who together were known as the Court. He and the others demanded that the people of Albion bow down before them. When the people refused, the Court \"burned Albion until the earth turned black and the sky was thick with smoke\". When the people refused a second time, they lifted the sea into the sky and flooded the world. The third time they demanded worship, they claimed that they would bring peace, but again the people refused, so the Court twisted their minds until they went insane. Finally, the inhabitants bowed to the Court.",

If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as 40 days. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power at its disposal and the devastation it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude.",

Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas. It is also one of few pokemon capable of Gigantamaxing.",

Due to a past incident involving the apparent death of her younger sister, Lisanna, Mirajane somehow lost much of her magical ability and her will to fight (both of which have since returned), and her personality changed drastically. Now, Mirajane is a loving and caring person who treats her friends, and even strangers, with kindness. Mirajane plays a motherly role within the guild, and is often seen running the bar at the guild hall.",

However, when she abused this power to go back in time before she even attended Luna Nova, she was afflicted with the Curse of Time, and doomed to the fate of becoming the Ghost Witch with the professors having no other choice but to seal her away in the chamber. Two-hundred years later, her uncorrupted human half left Atsuko Kagari and her friends a book that gave instructions on how to unseal the chamber. This would in turn, activate the chamber's failsafe and trap them and the school in a time loop. With Akko gradually learning the truth, she makes it her mission to save Molly from her fate and end the curse for good.",

Its mood swings are erratic; when it is calm it is good, but when it is in a bad mood, it has an uncontrollable side. It seems that Moosemon's mood is linked with the climate of the mountains, and it is told that when unexplained thunder or avalanches occur from time to time, they are due to Moosemon's ill temper.",

He learned that friendship there was basically dying, and as a result the Sky Prism had partially shattered, which could have eventually led to the Sky Pavilion falling on the PokéPark itself. Mew took this as an opportunity to test his friend and save PokéPark at the same time, manipulating events so that specific people, such as those running Attractions, came to find or were given the shards of the Sky Prism that Pikachu needed. Over the course of the game Pikachu gets stronger, tougher, and grows far beyond he ever thought possible, as he gains each Sky Prism shard and even saves the Park itself.",

The Tales of Albion states that she appeared with Jack of Blades and The Knight of Blades (together known as The Court) from The Void. The Queen and the others are said to have demanded that all the inhabitants of Albion bow down before them. When they were refused, they \"burned Albion until the earth turned black and the sky was thick with smoke\". When the people refused a second time, they lifted the sea into the sky and flooded the world. The third time they demanded worship they said they would bring peace, but again the people refused, so the court twisted their minds until they went insane. Finally, the people of Albion bowed to the court.",

Following the Avengers Civil War, the two rekindled their relationship, eventually getting married and having a daughter, Morgan, when Tony returned from his failed battle with the genocidal alien warlord Thanos on Titan, who ultimately used a completed Infinity Gauntlet to wipe out half of all life in the entire universe.",

Before he left, though, he gave each master a gift—a sword that embodied the principles, skills, and philosophy of the recipient’s first discipline. “As long as these swords remain together, the Temple will never fail,” he told the Nine Masters. “Now I go.” And he set off alone, on foot and unarmed, because he feared nothing in the world. No one ever saw him again.",

Thor decided to actualize Ragnarök and use Surtur's power to defeat and kill Hela. After the Asgardians were out of harm's way, Loki resurrected Surtur, who erupted from Asgard moments later. Surtur destroyed Asgard, and killed Hela and himself in the process.",

His main objective was to bring stability from the universe, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's resources and condemn it. However, his methodology to succeed was warped; through the use of the ancient Infinity Stones, he intended to harness their power to exterminate half of all life in the universe, thus returning it to what he perceived to be a state of cosmic balance.",

This is most commonly accepted, as Theresa states in the ruined Chamber of Fate that the Hero of Oakvale was the Hero of Bowerstone's \"forebear\". This is also proven in \"The Hero of Oakvale\", one of the books in Albion, where it speaks of the Hero of Oakvale having a descendant who shall one day save Albion. There is more reason to believe this, with the addition of access to the treasure chest of the Hero of Southcliff, in the Chamber of Fate. Out-of-game lore suggests that only the descendants of the Hero can open the chest.",

Yet my power now is nothing to that which I am soon to reach, when I reach forth from the very center of multiversal disintegration and reorder the cosmos, according to my whims, from first to last dimension. Those who stand against me will be wiped from existence, as if they had never been. But those who now forswear past allegiance and pledge themselves to the one supreme lord of creation may be brought into the new world. Decide soon, for reality rapidly speeds toward dissolution and my ultimate ascension.",

The first use of these mysterious artifacts proved catastrophic, as they reshaped the landscape of entire nations. Mistrust quickly grew as those who knew of the Runes imagined such “Makers’ Might” being used as a weapon. Conflicts later related to these magical artifacts were known as the Rune Wars.",

For the satyrs of the Skola Valley on Theros, pleasure, revelry, and mischief are virtues of the highest regard. Xenagos is the epitome of these ideals. While he does not rule the satyrs, Xenagos savors his role as de facto revelry host. When his Planeswalker spark ignited, he was excited to bring his boisterous, carefree hedonism to distant planes. His goal was to discover all the pleasures of the Multiverse...but what he found instead was disillusionment. On Theros, his gods were real, but elsewhere, they held no influence. This began to gnaw at Xenagos, who ultimately returned to his home plane. While he tried to throw himself back into the revelries, they no longer gave him the same level of amusement. The natural order of things on Theros had become a farce to Xenagos, and he refused to play the fool. Where once Xenagos lived only for the moment, his newfound awareness of the Multiverse had ruined his ability to lose himself in the bedlam of satyr festivities. However, he refuses to succumb to listlessness, and just as he has been known to push revelries a few steps too far, Xenagos is now working a plan to elevate himself from mortal to god.",

You need only peer into a demon’s eyes to know evil is not some vacuum waiting for virtue to come and fill its emptiness. Evil is a force. It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable. Understand, there is no redemption, only treason against the side you were born to serve.",

Despite her intimidating exterior, she deeply cares for her comrades and treats them as if they were family, as she lost her own after her hometown was ransacked by fanatical worshippers of the Dark Mage Zeref and was forced to build the Tower of Heaven. She was imprisoned together with several other slaves, most of which were children. Among these children were Jellal Fernandes, Shô, Simon, Wally Buchanan, and Millianna. While they asked each other for their names, she said that her name was just \"Erza.\" Hence, Jellal decided to give her the surname \"Scarlet\" after her scarlet hair so they would never forget it. Eventually, she rebelled against the cult and escaped, but not without losing Jellal, who had been corrupted by Zeref's Dark Arts. She also served as the guild's 7th Guild Master during Makarov's absence in X792.",

Gaining her power from Asgard, Hela planned to rule Asgard and create an Asgardian Empire. When all the people of Asgard refused to bow to her, Hela set about massacring Odin's armies and enslaving the people, while recruiting Skurge to be her own Executioner in the process. Eventually, however, Thor returned with the newly formed Revengers and then reengaged Hela, which had then resulted in Loki unleashing Surtur, who then destroyed Asgard by finally causing Ragnarök and killed Hela as a result.",

He and the others demanded that the people of Albion bow down before them. When the people refused, the Court \"burned Albion until the earth turned black and the sky was thick with smoke\". When the people refused a second time, they lifted the sea into the sky and flooded the world. The third time they demanded worship, they claimed that they would bring peace, but again the people refused, so the Court twisted their minds until they went insane.

Mew took this as an opportunity to test his friend and save PokéPark at the same time, manipulating events so that specific people, such as those running Attractions, came to find or were given the shards of the Sky Prism that Pikachu needed. Over the course of the game Pikachu gets stronger, tougher, and grows far beyond he ever thought possible, as he gains each Sky Prism shard and even saves the Park itself.",

    "Summary": "Regigigas is a large, white, golem Pokémon with seven black dot-like \"eyes\" arranged in a specific pattern. The dot pattern is Regigigas's way of showing its anger: its eyes glow red when it is mad. It has six spots that are apart from its eyes, which seem to be gemstones. These gemstones seem to represent the Regis, with the red gems representing Regirock, the blue gems representing Regice, and the silver gems representing Registeel. It has long arms, with three fairly human-like white fingers, and short legs. It has large yellow bands on its shoulders and wrists, with a sloping section on its chest that appears to be its head also being yellow. Its body is covered in black stripes, and it has moss growing in its back and feet, which may indicate it has been asleep for a long time. It can communicate via telepathy.",

No one ever saw him again.",

Long before the mortals were born, there were gods and primordials, creating chaos and law as they saw fit. One such being was Asgorath, the first dragon who battled a terrifying Primordial in an event known as the Dawn War. Despite his impressive strength, Asgorath was overcome- but from his corpse split two entities, one good, one evil, who destroyed their father's murderer and created the foundations for the Dragon Pantheon. These beings were Bahamut (the Good) and Tiamat (the Evil).",

A comforting thought, I imagine, for those seeking redemption, but, I tell you, put such thoughts from your mind. You need only peer into a demon’s eyes to know evil is not some vacuum waiting for virtue to come and fill its emptiness. Evil is a force. It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable. Understand, there is no redemption, only treason against the side you were born to serve.",

However, when she abused this power to go back in time before she even attended Luna Nova, she was afflicted with the Curse of Time, and doomed to the fate of becoming the Ghost Witch with the professors having no other choice but to seal her away in the chamber. Two-hundred years later, her uncorrupted human half left Atsuko Kagari and her friends a book that gave instructions on how to unseal the chamber. This would in turn, activate the chamber's failsafe and trap them and the school in a time loop. With Akko gradually learning the truth, she makes it her mission to save Molly from her fate and end the curse for good.",

One such being was Asgorath, the first dragon who battled a terrifying Primordial in an event known as the Dawn War.

Few could even begin to understand the importance of their origins, or the sheer power held within them. Some surmised that the Runes were integral to the creation of Runeterra itself. The first use of these mysterious artifacts proved catastrophic, as they reshaped the landscape of entire nations. Mistrust quickly grew as those who knew of the Runes imagined such “Makers’ Might” being used as a weapon. Conflicts later related to these magical artifacts were known as the Rune Wars.",

Garp, a powerful Marine Vice-Admiral who had cornered the late Pirate King himself on several occasions; the sworn brother of late \"Fire Fist\" Portgas D.

He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. During his battle with Kaidou in Onigashima, Luffy manages to awaken the true potential of his Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, tapping into his Gear 5th, granting his rubber-like body increased physical strength and freedom, limited only by his imagination.",

He's the son of Yasopp, a sharpshooter serving under Shanks, and comes from the East Blue. Usopp had a reputation on his home island of being a serial liar who claimed that pirates were attacking, which came back to haunt him when real pirates actually attacked. He's a rather boastful seventeen/nineteen-year-old who likes to tell tall tales (several of which actually do come true, after a fashion), though he's more prone to hiding behind the stronger crew members such as Zoro when he actually gets into a fight. However, when push comes to shove, he is very dependable. He specializes in the use of a slingshot, called the Galaxy Slingshot (Ginga Pachinko), which he replaced with the Kabuto and later the Black Kabuto. This slingshot, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies, and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.",

He is one of the longest running primary adversaries of the series as well as the first enemy to hand Luffy a complete and utter defeat, not once but twice. He secretly formed a criminal organization called Baroque Works, whose public aim was to take over the prosperous of Alabasta and create a utopia and led it as its president. To accomplish this, he worked to undermine Alabasta King's influence by defeating criminals before the royal army could, and by exploiting a drought in order to pit the kingdom against an army of rebels. His Devil Fruit, the Sand-Sand Fruit (Suna Suna no Mi), lets him turn into and control sand, a very useful ability in the desert kingdom.",

He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. During his battle with Kaidou in Onigashima, Luffy manages to awaken the true potential of his Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, tapping into his Gear 5th, granting his rubber-like body increased physical strength and freedom, limited only by his imagination.",

Its goal is the absorption of the World of Trophy into Subspace, done by the usage of Subspace Bombs. As Tabuu cannot leave Subspace, most of the forces are located in the World of Trophy while Tabuu manipulates them from Subspace. Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",

Usopp had a reputation on his home island of being a serial liar who claimed that pirates were attacking, which came back to haunt him when real pirates actually attacked. He's a rather boastful seventeen/nineteen-year-old who likes to tell tall tales (several of which actually do come true, after a fashion), though he's more prone to hiding behind the stronger crew members such as Zoro when he actually gets into a fight. However, when push comes to shove, he is very dependable. He specializes in the use of a slingshot, called the Galaxy Slingshot (Ginga Pachinko), which he replaced with the Kabuto and later the Black Kabuto. This slingshot, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies, and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.",

He encountered the Straw Hats when he and the Franky Family brutally beat Usopp and stole a great deal of money from the crew while they were attempting to get their boat fixed on the island. However, his interests subsequently aligned with the Straw Hats' when the secret government organization CP9 kidnapped both him and their crewmate Nico Robin in a bid to construct the ancient superweapon Pluton, which he owned the blueprints to. After escaping the clutches of CP9, Franky decided to join their crew, drawn by their dedication to both their ship and their fellow crewmen.",

    "Summary": "Kage (影, Shadow) is a character introduced in Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition. After Ryu overcame the temptations of the Satsui no Hado dwelling within him, it was assumed that Evil Ryu had been vanquished. Yet somehow, the Satsui no Hado developed sentience and came to manifest as its own entirely separate, physical entity, naming itself \"Kagenaru Mono\" (影ナル者, The Shadowed One). Kage lives to show and prove to Ryu that he is nothing without him and seeks out to challenge Akuma and Sagat, two of Ryu’s most notorious rivals. But these endeavors were ultimately fruitless for Kage, because even after fighting them, they comment on how he is nothing but an impudent, ignorant and soulless silhouette that doesn't have the strength to break a true warrior's will.",

Dragon, a revolutionary considered \"The World's Most Dangerous Criminal\"; the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, a powerful Marine Vice-Admiral who had cornered the late Pirate King himself on several occasions; the sworn brother of late \"Fire Fist\" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo; and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. During his battle with Kaidou in Onigashima, Luffy manages to awaken the true potential of his Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, tapping into his Gear 5th, granting his rubber-like body increased physical strength and freedom, limited only by his imagination.",

The Shobijin promised that Mothra would defend Japan against the second Godzilla in Kiryu's place if her demands were met. While Mothra's pleas were unheeded, she nevertheless appeared in Tokyo to battle Godzilla when he came ashore. Kiryu was launched into battle to aid Mothra, who was seriously wounded in the battle. Mothra's twin larvae arrived in Tokyo to assist their mother, but she was killed when she deflected a blast of Godzilla's atomic breath that was aimed at her offspring.",

However, Saitama was only holding back. Rover regains consciousness after a bit, only seeing Saitama again when he awakens. Orochi orders Rover to help him, but wisely, Rover ran away.",

He trained alongside his friendly rival Ken under their mutual master Gouken and was the victor of the first Street Fighter tournament. His encounter with his master's nemesis Akuma during the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series awoke the untapped Satsui no Hadou or \"murderous intent\" within him although this power was eventually overwhelmed in Street Fighter V, when he mastered the Power of Nothingness, a source of higher power arising from a state of consciousness in which the mind is free from thoughts and emotions. In Street Fighter III, he continues to travel the world in search of strong opponents.",

The next day, he lifts Paper Princess Peach's castle high up into the sky atop his own castle and empowers himself with the Star Rod to such a degree that Paper Mario is unable to damage him, being quickly defeated and blasted out of the castle. Once Paper Mario rescues the seven Star Spirits, he returns to Paper Princess Peach's castle and rematches Paper Bowser, being able to overpower the latter's invulnerability with the Star Spirits' Star Beam. Paper Bowser retreats to a platform built by Kammy Koopa to power him up even further, to the point of being unaffected by the Star Beam. However, the combined strength of Twink and the wishes of the entire Mushroom Kingdom upgrade the Star Beam into the Peach Beam, with which Paper Mario is able to defeat Paper Bowser and reclaim the Star Rod, which the Star Spirits return to Star Haven.",

Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",

Usopp had a reputation on his home island of being a serial liar who claimed that pirates were attacking, which came back to haunt him when real pirates actually attacked. He's a rather boastful seventeen/nineteen-year-old who likes to tell tall tales (several of which actually do come true, after a fashion), though he's more prone to hiding behind the stronger crew members such as Zoro when he actually gets into a fight. However, when push comes to shove, he is very dependable. He specializes in the use of a slingshot, called the Galaxy Slingshot (Ginga Pachinko), which he replaced with the Kabuto and later the Black Kabuto. This slingshot, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies, and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.",

When Vercci heard that his possessions have been ransacked as a result of civil war in Italy, he had his personal fleet travel to an uninhabited island off the coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea and dug a 50-mt deep shaft that would serve as his tomb and as a vault for his remaining fortune. After killing off the sailors under Vercci's orders, Voldo becomes the guardian of the Money Pit. But he would emerge from the Money Pit, either to continue the search for the Soul Edge or hunt down thieves that steal from the vault in his absence.",

    "Summary": "Lemmy Koopa is the smallest member of the Koopalings, one of Bowser's elite fighters in the Koopa Troops. He is usually associated with his star-patterned magic balls and depicted as a silly, innocent, fun-loving and immature child who enjoys playing. He favors partaking in circus acts rather than causing misdeeds, but is capable of being serious when the situation calls for it. Like most of the Koopalings, he is named after a famous musician. Lemmy is named after the English musician and founder of a heavy metal band, Lemmy Kilmister, due to the character preferring to do his own thing, regardless of what other people think.",

The next day, he lifts Paper Princess Peach's castle high up into the sky atop his own castle and empowers himself with the Star Rod to such a degree that Paper Mario is unable to damage him, being quickly defeated and blasted out of the castle. Once Paper Mario rescues the seven Star Spirits, he returns to Paper Princess Peach's castle and rematches Paper Bowser, being able to overpower the latter's invulnerability with the Star Spirits' Star Beam. Paper Bowser retreats to a platform built by Kammy Koopa to power him up even further, to the point of being unaffected by the Star Beam. However, the combined strength of Twink and the wishes of the entire Mushroom Kingdom upgrade the Star Beam into the Peach Beam, with which Paper Mario is able to defeat Paper Bowser and reclaim the Star Rod, which the Star Spirits return to Star Haven.",

Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery.

When Vercci heard that his possessions have been ransacked as a result of civil war in Italy, he had his personal fleet travel to an uninhabited island off the coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea and dug a 50-mt deep shaft that would serve as his tomb and as a vault for his remaining fortune. After killing off the sailors under Vercci's orders, Voldo becomes the guardian of the Money Pit. But he would emerge from the Money Pit, either to continue the search for the Soul Edge or hunt down thieves that steal from the vault in his absence.",

He is a member of the Yoshi species and has aided his brethren in saving their homeland on multiple occasions. In his youth, Yoshi managed to rescue and protect Baby Mario and Baby Luigi from the wrath of Kamek and the Koopa Troop. According to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Yoshi is one of the few members of his species who can speak the language of the other characters, though it seems that this is not his first language, since, as in other games, his statements are translated through parentheses. In the Mario series, he is a major character and often acts as a steed for Mario and other protagonists, while in most of the Mario sports and party games, he is a playable character.",

Bege is a cunning and crafty opportunist who always goes after the head honchos and no one else, just to enjoy watching their organizations dissolve into chaos after he knocks off the boss.",

He considers himself far superior to humans, calling himself a 'new human' that Dr. Genus was looking for, and believing that all should bow to his will. Carnage Kabuto is also very sarcastic and low-tempered, which is considered by Genus to be one of his main failures.",

After his parents' death in his 14th year, he took a sword and the last name Mitsurugi. He went to train under the powerful warlord of the Murakami clan. At this time, Japan was in the middle of the Sengoku Jidai or \"the age of the country at war\" in which the feudal lords or \"daimyos\" attempted to claim the title of Shogun. Mitsurugi was a powerful force on the battlefield, and rumors of him spread like wildfire, heralding him as the warrior that could mow down foes like fields of wheat, and he was noted by Uesugi Kenshin and Oda Nobunaga as a great warrior. He received numerous military commendations and eventually reached the rank of commissioned officer in the Japanese armed forces. But all along, his only true desire was a worthy opponent.",

    "Summary": "Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・Dディー・ルフィ, Monki Di Rufi?), known as \"Straw Hat Luffy\", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He's the son of Monkey D. Dragon, a revolutionary considered “The World's Most Dangerous Criminal”; the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, a powerful Marine Vice-Admiral who had cornered the late Pirate King himself on several occasions; the sworn brother of late \"Fire Fist\" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo; and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. With the support from Silvers Rayleigh and the desire to reunite with his crew after the Sabaody Island Incident and the Marineford War, he endured vigorous training on the island of Ruskaina where he learned the 3 forms of Haki, and out of the three, he specialized in “Haoshoku Haki”.",

When Saitama shows up, the creature attempts to stop him, but Saitama, seeing him as a dog, punches Rover down. Amazingly, this merely knocks the monster unconscious instead of killing it. However, Saitama was only holding back. Rover regains consciousness after a bit, only seeing Saitama again when he awakens. Orochi orders Rover to help him, but wisely, Rover ran away.",

When Vercci heard that his possessions have been ransacked as a result of civil war in Italy, he had his personal fleet travel to an uninhabited island off the coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea and dug a 50-mt deep shaft that would serve as his tomb and as a vault for his remaining fortune. After killing off the sailors under Vercci's orders, Voldo becomes the guardian of the Money Pit. But he would emerge from the Money Pit, either to continue the search for the Soul Edge or hunt down thieves that steal from the vault in his absence.",
