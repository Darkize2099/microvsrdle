Primarily taking the form of a sword made from living darkness, All-Black was wielded by Knull during the dark god's deicidal rampage, earning it the monikers of the Necrosword and Godslayer. After Knull was seemingly killed in battle against a group of golden-armored gods, All-Black left him and bonded to a misotheistic alien called Gorr who unwittingly followed in Knull's footsteps, using it to slay gods across the cosmos and earning the title of the God Butcher. Feeding off the slain gods' blood, All-Black corrupted Gorr into a kind of evil god himself, bestowing him with immortality and a host of other abilities. As a result of Knull and Gorr's deicidal campaigns, All-Black became the subject of countless stories and legends containing grains of the truth. All-Black served as both the detonator and payload of Gorr's Godbomb, a moon-sized explosive built using the designs of Shadrak the God of Bombs to kill all gods across time and space.",

This divergence of ideas ushered in a Celestial War for the dominion of all existence. They fought against the rebellious Celestials and created the Godkiller Armor to turn the tide of the battle and annihilate the Celestials. The Godkiller was later stripped of some of its components to provide key elements for the Aspirants' fleets, which entered a civil war. This internal conflict gave the Celestials time to recover and eventually crush the Aspirants.",

Their thoughts and nature inscrutable and unknowable to lesser species, they have meddled with the evolution of countless species and civilizations across the universe, evolving, judging, destroying and experimenting on whole worlds as they see fit, all for the sake of perpetuating the evolution of all life in the greater cosmos. The influence of the Celestials is, itself, the very reason for why the Earth is a fertile ground for superhumans: Aeons ago, a wounded Celestial known as the Progenitor descended upon the planet, and, spilling the primordial earth with its innards, infused it with its own energies.",

Born from the primordial void that existed between the sixth and seventh cosmos, Knull claims dominion over the void and to be its avatar, but while he is a God of the Void he is not the primordial darkness itself. Awakened by the Light when the Celestials invaded his kingdom of darkness, he created the first symbiote in the form of a sword and decapitated a Celestial. He used the head's divine power to refine the blade, creating a metaphysical connection between the primordial symbiote and the slain cosmic god - which would be the source of most of Knull's tremendous power. Waging war against the Light, Knull became a legendary figure of divine terror but eventually found himself stranded on a nameless planet after an inhabitant stole his blade and unwittingly followed in his footsteps. Experimenting with his powers, Knull discovered he could create amorphous parasites from the darkness he controls and merge them with \"lesser creatures\", so he decided to use this as a way to corrupt the Light.",

A being beyond all realities and even existence itself, they are charged with the creation and destruction of universes, acting in both harsh and kind ways, being both cold and forgiving at the same time. Little was known of their entity or appearance, and even the greatest of overgods, Ao, seemed to bend to their every whim, carrying out their will with obedience, although he later possibly reneged this relationship. The being was commonly thought to be a stand-in, or physical representation, for the Dungeon Master of the setting, as such a being projected into the cosmology's laws would shape and mold all reality within the confines of that setting.",

    "Summary": "The Phantom Stranger, formerly known as Judas Iscariot, is a member of the infamous Trinity of Sin, a group of the three most egregious sinners in history. Judas' betrayal of Jesus Christ earned him membership in the group, and he was cursed with immortality, doomed to wander and serve the Presence until he gained redemption. He wears a necklace made of his pieces of silver, losing one piece each time he completes a significant task for the Presence. His mission has forced him to become both hero and betrayer, and he has become a legendary mystical figure over his centuries of wandering.",

After the former Wrath of God, Eclipso overstepped his bounds and was cast out of his role, the Spectre took up his duties. The Spectre was cast into Limbo with the birth of Christ, and after the crucifixion the Spectre returned with a vengeance, only to learn from Michael that the Presence had decreed his aspects must now walk the Earth bound to mortal souls.",

    "Summary": "The Traveler was a shapeshifting being of unknown origin, who came from a higher dimension to experience the lower reality of humans, trading his advanced knowledge of the universe with Starfleet crews, so that they might give him passage to other worlds and vessels and present him with the possibility of worthy individuals to pass his gifts onto. \"He,\" and his species existed outside of time and space, and usually only entered the lower realities when they were looking for individuals that they deemed worthy enough to accompany them on their journeys throughout the cosmos. Their kind could shape the laws of reality with their very thoughts, and move through different realms and dimensions with ease, as well as affect the constants of the universe to a lesser, but comparable degree to members of the Q continuum. After an unknown amount of time functioning as a guest aboard many different Starfleet vessels, the Traveler took interest in the young Wesley Crusher, an ensign aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. He eventually helped the young Wesley develop his own Traveler powers, culminating in their final meeting, where the Traveler took him outside the scope of 3-dimensional reality to explore the vastness of the multiverse.",

It is a legendary being like the other Four Holy Beast Digimon, and its strength is said to equal that of a god. Also, it is counted as one of the Four Great Dragons alongside Holydramon, Goddramon, and Megidramon, and is the most deified existence among them. However, although it is a divine being, it will not easily cooperate with humans and the weak, and it is not likely to lend help to its allies unless there is something serious.",

    "Summary": "Bagramon is a Demon Lord Digimon. Although it was originally a high-ranking Angel Digimon that ruled over death, it despaired against the unreasonable justice of the world and rebelled against God. It then received the scourge of God and eternally lost one of its eyes and half of its body, and has since replaced that half with an artificial body cut from Yggdrasill. Its long, artificial right arm can catch hold of ghostly forms, and the large ruby that it replaced its lost eye with allows it to observe anywhere within the Digital World. Due to these, Bagramon is known across the Digital World as the \"Sage of Death\". Although Bagramon's sins will be forgiven if it repented before God, it will not go back to submission under God. This is because it still seeks to replace the \"Unreasonable Justice of the World\" that God constructed, and its goal in life is to banish God from the world with its \"New Justice\".",

Also, although it is the youngest of the Sovereigns, its power is the greatest among the four.

As it is a boss that only serves its own \"Justice\", if something becomes an obstacle to that \"Justice\", it will see them as \"Evil\" even if they are a being like the Royal Knights or the Three Great Angels, and they will become an enemy that it has to eliminate. The \"GAKU-RAN\" worn over its shoulders is endowed with a defensive function that negates 89.9% of the opponent's physical strikes.",

As a follower of the Four Holy Beasts Digimon Zhuqiaomon, it has an intolerably arrogant personality. When it opens its mouth only bragging comes out, and it is constantly fussing over the glossiness of its mane and tail. It indulges in its talents, and ridicules those who work hard. Among the Deva, it is on especially bad terms with Vajramon. Though it fusses over its appearance, in battle it is comparatively unrefined; using the gigantic Bǎo Bèi trumpet shell tied to its arms, it beats the opponent down by wielding it like a cudgel.",

    "Summary": "Marsmon is a member of the enigmatic \"Olympos XII\", it is a Digimon god of war with the appearance of a panther-man. The Olympos XII lie in the shadows and possess ability rivaling that of the guardian deities of the Net, the \"Royal Knights\", and each protects its own domain while maintaining a position of neutrality regarding the incidents which arise in the Digital World. Marsmon is well-versed in all sorts of combat techniques known throughout the world, including underhanded techniques, and has absolute confidence in battles against others in the same weight class. While Marsmon typically uses wrestling techniques, it is so fixated on victory and glory that when push comes to shove, it will not hesitate to use concealed weapons such as its \"Tria Knuckle\" or \"Metal Cothurnus\". However, its true power is exhibited when it uses its bare hands and feet.",

It links with gates and overcomes predicaments by controlling the forces of the Angel and Fallen Angel-tribes it summons from another Digital World. It is because of the nature possessed by Mastemon, who is called the \"Tactician from Another World\", that it unifies both species, which are usually hostile to each other. While it is a Jogress Evolution of the opposing two, it possesses a single-minded heart.",

It is one of the Three Archangel Digimon who protect the Digital World's core \"Kernel\" (God's domain), alongside Seraphimon and Cherubimon. As the Digital World's Holy Mother-like being, it imparts the loving and merciful side of God, while Seraphimon is the executor of the enlightened God's laws, and Cherubimon is the guardian of God and its wisdom; each has their own duty.. It was responsible for banishing the former Angel-species Cho-Hakkaimon from heaven for an unspecified crime, but it's also thought that Lilithmon, who fell from heaven and became known as the \"Goddess of Darkness\", was itself originally an Ophanimon.",

    "Summary": "Ordinemon is a Digimon with gigantic, jet-black wings; the truth about it is still unclear, and it is theorized by a portion of researchers to appear when the Digital World has been plunged into chaos and is meeting its end. Although it was originally an Angel Digimon whose role was to maintain order, it was said to have fallen due to its wrath and sorrow and fused with another Digimon, giving rise to Ordinemon. Negative emotions themselves flow out of Ordinemon's wings, and a flap of its wings will spread miasma throughout its surroundings. The endlessly overflowing miasma is capable of eventually covering the entire world, resulting in the end of all life. However, its true nature is one of kindness, a high-standing being who plans to save the world by first returning the world, which has lost its order, to nothingness.",

After Knull was seemingly killed in battle against a group of golden-armored gods, All-Black left him and bonded to a misotheistic alien called Gorr who unwittingly followed in Knull's footsteps, using it to slay gods across the cosmos and earning the title of the God Butcher. Feeding off the slain gods' blood, All-Black corrupted Gorr into a kind of evil god himself, bestowing him with immortality and a host of other abilities. As a result of Knull and Gorr's deicidal campaigns, All-Black became the subject of countless stories and legends containing grains of the truth. All-Black served as both the detonator and payload of Gorr's Godbomb, a moon-sized explosive built using the designs of Shadrak the God of Bombs to kill all gods across time and space.",

They fought against the rebellious Celestials and created the Godkiller Armor to turn the tide of the battle and annihilate the Celestials. The Godkiller was later stripped of some of its components to provide key elements for the Aspirants' fleets, which entered a civil war. This internal conflict gave the Celestials time to recover and eventually crush the Aspirants.",

Circumstantially, other super heroes – namely Iron Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp – also received the intercepted signal unbeknownst to Loki and arrived at the scene to reason with the green goliath. Not falling for the trick, Thor confronted Loki and exposed his scheme to the other heroes. With Loki defeated and captured, the group agreed they had worked well together and should be formalized as a team. The Wasp suggested the name Avenger, and Earth's Mightiest Heroes were born.",

It then received the scourge of God and eternally lost one of its eyes and half of its body, and has since replaced that half with an artificial body cut from Yggdrasill. Its long, artificial right arm can catch hold of ghostly forms, and the large ruby that it replaced its lost eye with allows it to observe anywhere within the Digital World. Due to these, Bagramon is known across the Digital World as the \"Sage of Death\". Although Bagramon's sins will be forgiven if it repented before God, it will not go back to submission under God. This is because it still seeks to replace the \"Unreasonable Justice of the World\" that God constructed, and its goal in life is to banish God from the world with its \"New Justice\".",

Against all chances, Adam lived, with the alien metal merging with his flesh and the surplus energy propelling him twenty years forward in time.",

Regardless, the character still steared closely to her creator's original idea, her origin story being given as that of an agent pertaining to a secret governmental organization nominated Alpha-13, who, in a mention with the objective of thwarting the supervillain Madame Atom's plan of detonating a nuclear drill within a Ziggurat holding vast amounts of divine power within itself, thus taking the elemental force of an unspecified Sumerian god unto her body and becoming the most powerful being in the Universe. Attempting to deactivate Atom's drill by hand, Caroline eventually ran low on time and the drill exploded within the Ziggurat, embuing her with the powerful magic contained in the construction and drastically mutating her appearance into that of an inorganic, blue-skinned chimeric humanoid, as a result granting her the power to fully control her own atomic structure, thus turning her into the titular Formless Girl.",

To wield a Cosmic Cube is to hold reality, time and space in one's fingertips, acquiring the ability to reshape them into any desirable state with nothing but a thought, and as such, many have sought their power, most notably the Red Skull, who employed one such artifact in his repeated attempts at world domination.",

    "Summary": "Tomi Shishido, better known as The Gorgon is a mutant genius born in Kyoto, Japan. Even in infancy, his talents showed, as at just two weeks old, he spoke his first words. At thirteen years of age, Shishido had devised a mathematical formula that without question, proved the existence of God, but this revelation changed Shishido in a catastrophic manner. Believing that God's existence hindered mankind as man would be little more than subservient slaves if God existed, Shishido began to hate all gods, and began to desire to kill a god, along with all life on earth. During this time, Shishido learned he had the mutant power to turn people into stone with a glance, and the Japanese media dubbed him \"Gorgon.\" Shortly after this, Gorgon formed the \"Dawn of the White Light,\" a mutant death cult that subjected Japan to relentless terror attacks to complete their mission of ending all life. At eighteen years old, he searched for the Hand, drawing their attention by killing all of his loved ones, and committing suicide to prove his dedication to the organization. The Hand resurrected Gorgon promptly after this, and within a short time he became their leader, allowing him to continue his mission of ending all life.",

The beauty of its plots is even said to be \"ingenuity, as if gushing forth\", so it makes sport of the enemy army by weaving formulaic tactics together with creative schemes. God Beast Digimon accounts for the majority of its army, which has overwhelming strength in terms of military power. Because it enjoys stimulating tactics, it uses the battlefield as Gravimon's testing ground. It is an investigative Digimon which continues to zealously research questions like how many casualties can be produced easily, which tactic lets it listen to a multitude of screams, what creative scheme will surprise the enemy or ally as they die, which method will cause all of the opponents to die without shedding blood, and so on.",

Born from the primordial void that existed between the sixth and seventh cosmos, Knull claims dominion over the void and to be its avatar, but while he is a God of the Void he is not the primordial darkness itself. Awakened by the Light when the Celestials invaded his kingdom of darkness, he created the first symbiote in the form of a sword and decapitated a Celestial. He used the head's divine power to refine the blade, creating a metaphysical connection between the primordial symbiote and the slain cosmic god - which would be the source of most of Knull's tremendous power. Waging war against the Light, Knull became a legendary figure of divine terror but eventually found himself stranded on a nameless planet after an inhabitant stole his blade and unwittingly followed in his footsteps. Experimenting with his powers, Knull discovered he could create amorphous parasites from the darkness he controls and merge them with \"lesser creatures\", so he decided to use this as a way to corrupt the Light.",

Though it uses sarcasm with an acrimonious tone, it charmingly ends all of its sentences with \"~chū\". As it's not very strong, it's not suited for flinging itself at the opponent, but by means of its powerful abilities of telekinesis, it freely operates a giant steel pestle as big as its own body, the Bǎo Chǔ.",

Odin took the child back with him to the gods' home of Asgard and adopted him, under the name of Loki. The boy grew into a skilled sorcerer, shape-shifter, and one of Asgard's staunchest defenders, often deploying his magics alongside the might of his foster brother Thor. But the mercurial God of Mischief could hinder the Asgardians, as much as help them, as when he tricked the blind god Hoder into slaying the otherwise invulnerable Balder with an enchanted spear made of mistletoe. And so the gods never fully trusted Loki. Yet in his selfish narcissism, he convinced himself it was Thor who stole his glory from him. If the thunder god fell, or so he thought, the love, and crown, of Asgard would be his. Thor's departure from Asgard to become guardian of Earth gave the god of mischief the perfect opportunity to slay him out of their father's sight. His repeated attacks on the thunder gods, and the mystical empowerment of Thor's enemies, have made Loki one of the greatest threats to our world as well as Asgard!\" - Origins of Siege: Loki by Fred van Lente",

    "Summary": "The eponymous Luminous Being is the supreme deity in the Dungeons and Dragons (Forgotten Realms) cosmology, existing both before and after the end of time, transcending it and all of its concepts entirely. A being beyond all realities and even existence itself, they are charged with the creation and destruction of universes, acting in both harsh and kind ways, being both cold and forgiving at the same time. Little was known of their entity or appearance, and even the greatest of overgods, Ao, seemed to bend to their every whim, carrying out their will with obedience, although he later possibly reneged this relationship. The being was commonly thought to be a stand-in, or physical representation, for the Dungeon Master of the setting, as such a being projected into the cosmology's laws would shape and mold all reality within the confines of that setting.",

Reece became a lowly laboratory technician working at a nuclear plant owned by the Acme Atomics Corporation. He was disgruntled by his job's long hours and low pay. One day, Reece accidentally activated an experimental particle generator, which bombarded him with an unknown form of radiation. The explosion horribly disfigured his face with scars in the shape of lightning bolts, but it also had a mutagenic effect on Reece, releasing his potential for psionic powers on a cosmic scale. Reece could now control all matter, even down to the molecular level, and all energy, and he now used his immense powers to take out his pent-up frustrations on the world under the moniker of Molecule Man.",

    "Summary": "Ogudomon is an Incarnation Digimon whose name is derived from the mythological Ogdoad, eight Egyptian deities who were counterbalanced by gender and element, and whose design is derived from the First Beast of Revelation. It is a grotesque \"Super Demon Lord\" that has seven legs, each with an eye beneath it and a sword pierced through the knee which bears one of the seals of the Seven Deadly Sins, as well as an eighth eye on its face. As it includes the whole of the Digital World's sins, and moreover, is a mysterious incarnation with the ability to atone for them all, the power of a Digimon with even a small amount of malice is offset, making it impossible for it to defeat Ogudomon.",

Although it was originally an Angel Digimon whose role was to maintain order, it was said to have fallen due to its wrath and sorrow and fused with another Digimon, giving rise to Ordinemon. Negative emotions themselves flow out of Ordinemon's wings, and a flap of its wings will spread miasma throughout its surroundings. The endlessly overflowing miasma is capable of eventually covering the entire world, resulting in the end of all life. However, its true nature is one of kindness, a high-standing being who plans to save the world by first returning the world, which has lost its order, to nothingness.",

This miraculous Digimon is able to pop up in every place, time, and space, and although its body is small, it can seal away the enemy's abilities with its own special ability, and then pulverize the opponent with a mighty blow. With its mischief-loving personality, it enjoys making computers run wild with its cherished spear, \"Fairy Tale\", that it always holds in its hands (although it has no ill intent).",

Wanda became a conduit of chaos magic, allowing her to shift probabilities and warp reality itself in the form of \"hexes\". After being saved from an angry mob by Magneto, the Scarlet Witch and her brother joined the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to fight for Magneto's mutant supremacy cause. Disagreeing with Magneto's ruthless approach, the twins left him and joined the super-heroic Avengers instead, as the Scarlet Witch.",

    "Summary": "The Scarlet Witch, a multiversal variant of her Sacred Timeline Self, existed in a timeline where she and Vision lived happily together. However, the Mind Stone began to die, which was going to kill Vision in the process. Devastated with his potential death, Wanda began using her magic to peer through the Multiverse to look for answers to save him. Although this proved to be impossible as Vision’s death was an absolute point in her timeline, which meant that she would not be able to reverse it. She decided to look for the Infinity Stones, disguising herself as The Watcher, and manipulated the Player into retrieving the Infinity Stones for her. Before causing any further damage to the Multiverse, she was stopped by the Player, who used the Infinity Stones to fracture her power across the Multiverse. She stopped her ways and chose to spend eternity with Vision inside the realm of the Soul Stone.",

Unseen and seemingly unknowable, the Beyonders have for the longest time remained subtle in their dealings with creatures from the inside of the omniverse, their most prominent and well-known deed being the gifting of minute amounts of energy from their universe, incubated within vessels and \"womb-spaces\" designed as homes for their child-units, the Cosmic Cubes, to have them eventually mature into fully-fledged Beyonders. In the process, they also gave birth to The Beyonder, the most well-known member of their race, whose role in the original Secret Wars had lasting repercussions for Prime Earth.",

The Spectre was cast into Limbo with the birth of Christ, and after the crucifixion the Spectre returned with a vengeance, only to learn from Michael that the Presence had decreed his aspects must now walk the Earth bound to mortal souls.",

Their kind could shape the laws of reality with their very thoughts, and move through different realms and dimensions with ease, as well as affect the constants of the universe to a lesser, but comparable degree to members of the Q continuum. After an unknown amount of time functioning as a guest aboard many different Starfleet vessels, the Traveler took interest in the young Wesley Crusher, an ensign aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. He eventually helped the young Wesley develop his own Traveler powers, culminating in their final meeting, where the Traveler took him outside the scope of 3-dimensional reality to explore the vastness of the multiverse.",

It can manipulate space-time (planned to move the Digital World to another universe, and it alone was able to seal the dimensional barrier at the end of Digimon Savers), and has power over life and death (he was able to revive Spencer Damon, although his body was destroyed and his soul had died with BanchoLeomon). Some of these powers were inherited by Bagramon when using Server tree parts to rebuild his body.",

Believing that God's existence hindered mankind as man would be little more than subservient slaves if God existed, Shishido began to hate all gods, and began to desire to kill a god, along with all life on earth. During this time, Shishido learned he had the mutant power to turn people into stone with a glance, and the Japanese media dubbed him \"Gorgon.\" Shortly after this, Gorgon formed the \"Dawn of the White Light,\" a mutant death cult that subjected Japan to relentless terror attacks to complete their mission of ending all life. At eighteen years old, he searched for the Hand, drawing their attention by killing all of his loved ones, and committing suicide to prove his dedication to the organization. The Hand resurrected Gorgon promptly after this, and within a short time he became their leader, allowing him to continue his mission of ending all life.",

Regardless, the character still steared closely to her creator's original idea, her origin story being given as that of an agent pertaining to a secret governmental organization nominated Alpha-13, who, in a mention with the objective of thwarting the supervillain Madame Atom's plan of detonating a nuclear drill within a Ziggurat holding vast amounts of divine power within itself, thus taking the elemental force of an unspecified Sumerian god unto her body and becoming the most powerful being in the Universe. Attempting to deactivate Atom's drill by hand, Caroline eventually ran low on time and the drill exploded within the Ziggurat, embuing her with the powerful magic contained in the construction and drastically mutating her appearance into that of an inorganic, blue-skinned chimeric humanoid, as a result granting her the power to fully control her own atomic structure, thus turning her into the titular Formless Girl.",

    "Summary": "\"After Odin, All-father of the Norse pantheon, slew the evil frost giants, he discovered they hid a human-sized baby in their midst. Odin took the child back with him to the gods' home of Asgard and adopted him, under the name of Loki. The boy grew into a skilled sorcerer, shape-shifter, and one of Asgard's staunchest defenders, often deploying his magics alongside the might of his foster brother Thor. But the mercurial God of Mischief could hinder the Asgardians, as much as help them, as when he tricked the blind god Hoder into slaying the otherwise invulnerable Balder with an enchanted spear made of mistletoe. And so the gods never fully trusted Loki. Yet in his selfish narcissism, he convinced himself it was Thor who stole his glory from him. If the thunder god fell, or so he thought, the love, and crown, of Asgard would be his. Thor's departure from Asgard to become guardian of Earth gave the god of mischief the perfect opportunity to slay him out of their father's sight. His repeated attacks on the thunder gods, and the mystical empowerment of Thor's enemies, have made Loki one of the greatest threats to our world as well as Asgard!\" - Origins of Siege: Loki by Fred van Lente",

It is caring for Hackmon just like its elder sister, and also acts as its escort while accompanying Gankoomon on its journey. Although it is trying to diligently carry out Gankoomon's request and assist in training with Hackmon, it frequently ends up reining in its elder sister's violent manner. A long time ago, in its previous life, it was out on the streets with its elder sister Noir, but they were saved by Gankoomon just as they were going to collapse from exhaustion. In order to repay Gankoomon for saving it and its elder sister, it puts all of its effort into being a chaperone for Hackmon. It coordinates with Jesmon, Noir, and nearby Digimon to respond to the unusual phenomena and signs of chaos that occur all over the Digital World. The triple-pronged \"Cross Barbée\" lance that it carries as a weapon has both an offensive side and a defensive side",

    "Summary": "The Traveler was a shapeshifting being of unknown origin, who came from a higher dimension to experience the lower reality of humans, trading his advanced knowledge of the universe with Starfleet crews, so that they might give him passage to other worlds and vessels and present him with the possibility of worthy individuals to pass his gifts onto. \"He,\" and his species existed outside of time and space, and usually only entered the lower realities when they were looking for individuals that they deemed worthy enough to accompany them on their journeys throughout the cosmos. Their kind could shape the laws of reality with their very thoughts, and move through different realms and dimensions with ease, as well as affect the constants of the universe to a lesser, but comparable degree to members of the Q continuum. After an unknown amount of time functioning as a guest aboard many different Starfleet vessels, the Traveler took interest in the young Wesley Crusher, an ensign aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. He eventually helped the young Wesley develop his own Traveler powers, culminating in their final meeting, where the Traveler took him outside the scope of 3-dimensional reality to explore the vastness of the multiverse.",

Thor: ... And what does a child deserve? What do they deserve who have fought tooth and nail? Who fight on still? Am I to surrender before they do? What would that make me? I say thee nay, nothing-believer. I say never. If there are but a thousand on the Earth who embrace the warmth in their souls--Who seek kindness, who share justice and love--I will fight for that thousand!

I have, time and again, watched everyone I care about go from young to old to departed in what feels like the pulse of a spark. I remember them all, or at least I remember the feelings I had for them. Sometimes the memories of when I was young are sharper, more vivid, than the Swindle who sold me a hyper-frame manifold just this morning. Sometimes I feel alone even when I am in a crowd. And yet, I do take pride in the work I do. I have helped to save millions of realities, even entire reality clusters. I know the work I do enables countless beings whom I will never even meet to be forged and live and dream and fall in love and create offspring and produce art and, yes, even to die. Am I melancholy? Perhaps, sometimes. But it is a small price to pay. As ever, I thank you for your interest in my own well-being.",

Once a noble and good-natured child (if somewhat jealous of his brother), he was bitten by the Great Devourer, an ancient snake mutated by the power of The Overlord. The venom of the Great Devourer began to change his personality, slowly making him into an evil and cruel person. Though this was at first imperceptible, the evil in his veins slowly began to manifest. Garmadon then became the student of the evil cultist Master Chen, who granted him the title of lordship. Chen also encouraged him to pursue a young Misako, who his brother was also wooing, by stealing a letter from Wu and claiming it to be his. After Chen's manipulation of the Serpentine and Ninjago's citizens led to war between the two factions, Garmadon rejoined his brother and the Elemental Masters, ultimately defeating the Serpentine and forcing them underground.",

However, on the day he vowed to leave with Sora and Kairi, a freak storm hit that engulfed his world in darkness. Separated from his friends, Maleficent discovers his potential power and manipulates him into believing that Sora had forgotten and replaced him, stoking the inner darkness within Riku and turning him into an unwitting pawn despite his suspicions. Riku is later able to break free of the evil fairy's influence and decides to atone for his mistakes by sealing off the door to Kingdom Hearts along with King Mickey. His story did not end there, as he soon finds himself in Castle Oblivion's basement, having been guided there by Sora's heart. He takes this opportunity to continue assisting Sora from the shadows, but struggles with the darkness in his heart in spite of his attempts to embrace the light.",

The two inherited the powers of the Oni and the Dragon and trained under his father in the ways of Spinjitzu. After the corruption of Garmadon by the venom of The Great Devourer, Wu found himself more distant from his brother, though still on friendly terms, and along with his brother, took it upon himself to protect and safeguard The Golden Weapons after the death of his father. Many years later, his brother left to train under Master Chen, leaving the duty to him alone. Eventually, Wu met a young Morro, whom he found digging through his trash for food, and took pity on him, taking him in and training him in the Way of the. Ninja. Eventually, he found out that Morro was in actuality a descendant of the Master of Wind and believed him to be the foretold Green Ninja. However, this theory was found to be false when The Golden Weapons failed to react to Morro, who left the Monastery in anger and vowed to find The Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master, eventually suffocating to death in poison gas and becoming conscripted to The Cursed Realm for his crimes. Soon, however, Wu, found himself embroiled in The First Serpentine War, and alongside his brother and The Elemental Alliance, fought the Serpentine and defeated them using the sacred flute. Soon after, however, the Alliance and Wu were betrayed by the Masters of Time Krux and Acronix, who believed their power over the Element of Time made them superior to the other Elemental Masters. After being soundly defeated by the two, the group turned to the Masters of Water and Fire, Maya and Ray, who forged four blades of Chronosteel to absorb, and hold their power. As punishment, the Time Blades, as well as Krux and Acronix were scattered throughout time. Sometime after, Wu found himself facing his brother, whose corruption had finally fully manifested itself, over the weapons of their father, before accidentally killing him and sealing him in the underworld. In order to safeguard the Four Weapons, Wu hid the weapons in remote places and placed a dragon to guard each and gave the map to Ray and Maya. Many years later, Wu recruited the 4 ninja to help him protect the weapons against Garmadon’s army of Skulkin warriors, teaching them in the ways of Spinjitzu. Eventually, his nephew Lloyd and Kai’s Sister Nya joined the ranks of the ninja, who became Ninjago’s greatest heroes. Eventually, during a battle against the returned Krux and Acronix, Wu was lost in time, and was later found by the Sons of Garmadon, having been reverted to his infancy. Soon after, he was lost in The First Realm along with his students, and eventually regained his adulthood. Finding the legendary Dragon Armor, worn by his father in his youth, he gained the respect of The Firstbourne, and travelled back along with the ninja to fight the newly resurrected Garmadon.",

The four weapons each contain the immense power of the four basic elements, and when used together can manipulate the Elemental Essence of Creation, which allows the user to create something out of nothing, and manipulate the four main elements and the secondary elements that make up the world. After their retrieval from their hiding places by the ninja, they were stolen by Lord Garmadon and reforged into the immensely powerful Mega Weapon, which sacrificed its destructive capabilities to grant the user wishes and power over reality. After being shot into space following Garmadon's plan to go back in time and change the past, both the past and present sets of weapons were forged into The Golden Armor by The Overlord in order to fuel the missing 1% of golden power necessary to become The Golden Master. After The Overlord's defeat, The Golden Armor was hidden by Cyrus Borg in Hiroshi's Labyrinth for safekeeping. However, after the assault on Ninjago by The Oni, they were reforged into the Golden Weapons by Kai, but were depowered after the ninjas including Wu and Garmadon used the Tornado of Creation. They were later taken by the Cystal Council and turned into the '''Weapons of Destruction''' by Aspheera, they were later reclaimed by the ninja and turned back into their original state as pure elemental energy becoming the Golden Ultra Dragon.",

    "Summary": "In the First Realm, only two races existed, the Oni, and the Dragons, beings who controlled creation and destruction, and who fought each other in an eternal stalemate. One day, however, a child who was born of both the Oni and the Dragon was born. This child, known as the First Spinjitzu Master, was sought by both races as a means to end the war. Seeing that the two races would never find peace and couldn't understand the balance that was necessary for existence, left the realm to create his own, which became known as Ninjago. However, as the balance dictates that a world must have both good and evil, the Overlord - the dark spirit that had always existed - emerged into the Realm. The First Spinjitzu Master and the Overlord fought tirelessly and endlessly until The Overlord created a stone army to finally kill him. Knowing that he would eventually lose, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land in two, the Overlord being sealed into The Dark Island. However, the Overlord saw the arrival of Lord Garmadon, and thus waited for the ultimate battle between good and evil. Eventually, his prediction came to pass, with Lord Garmadon being betrayed by the Serpentine and left to rot in the ocean, eventually landing on the island. Manipulating Lord Garmadon and starting the Celestial Clock's countdown, which would dictate the beginning of the battle, The Overlord tricked him into spreading darkness through the Garmatron into Ninjago, shifting the balance back to darkness and restoring his powers. Forcibly taking over Garmadon's body and regaining his true form, and proceeded to corrupt all of Ninjago. However, he was ultimately soundly defeated by Lloyd Garmadon, who had become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master and was purged from Ninjago. Unfortunately for the Ninjas, the site of his defeat was still a foothold for him to remain and allowed him to take over Borg Industries, whose headquarters were built upon it. Taking over New Ninjago City’s infrastructure and the entirety of their computer system, he began a campaign to drain Lloyd’s power in order to become the Golden Master, a legendary being of Serpentine lore who held the powers of The First Spinjitzu Master at his peak, and would be fated to enslave the world. Eventually fulfilling this role with the power of the Golden Weapons, the Overlord was defeated by Zane, who sacrificed himself to turn the Overlord’s power against himself at the cost of his own life, purging his darkness from Ninjago once more.",

    "Summary": "The Stone Army is a villain faction that opposed the Ninja in the second season of Ninjago. To defeat the First Spinjitzu Master, The Overlord decided to use refined Dark Matter to create an army of indestructible warriors, that could be controlled only with a special item: the Helmet of Shadows. Once they fought the Creator of Ninjago, the latter was completely overwhelmed, as the Warriors were completely indestructible and immune to his powers, but he managed to create an Elemental Blade, which negated their invulnerability and immunity. Despite this, the Overlord and his servants were still too much for the First Spinjitzu Master to handle, as they pushed him to split Ninjago in half, sealing the Overlord in one of the new two continents, which became the Island of Darkness, and banishing the remaining Warriors of the Stone Army in a prison underground. Thousands of years later, the Stone Army was reawakened by the Great Devourer's poison and escaped their prison, and after going on a rampage on Ninjago, they forced the Ninja to retreat and to go to the Temple of Light to find the other Elemental Blades to regain their powers and to defeat both the Army and the Overlord, which came to power again thanks to Lord Garmadon.",

And yet, I do take pride in the work I do. I have helped to save millions of realities, even entire reality clusters. I know the work I do enables countless beings whom I will never even meet to be forged and live and dream and fall in love and create offspring and produce art and, yes, even to die. Am I melancholy? Perhaps, sometimes. But it is a small price to pay. As ever, I thank you for your interest in my own well-being.",

    "Summary": "Lord Garmadon is one of the 2 children of The First Spinjitzu Master, and is the older brother to Sensei Wu. Once a noble and good-natured child (if somewhat jealous of his brother), he was bitten by the Great Devourer, an ancient snake mutated by the power of The Overlord. The venom of the Great Devourer began to change his personality, slowly making him into an evil and cruel person. Though this was at first imperceptible, the evil in his veins slowly began to manifest. Garmadon then became the student of the evil cultist Master Chen, who granted him the title of lordship. Chen also encouraged him to pursue a young Misako, who his brother was also wooing, by stealing a letter from Wu and claiming it to be his. After Chen's manipulation of the Serpentine and Ninjago's citizens led to war between the two factions, Garmadon rejoined his brother and the Elemental Masters, ultimately defeating the Serpentine and forcing them underground.",

However, on the day he vowed to leave with Sora and Kairi, a freak storm hit that engulfed his world in darkness. Separated from his friends, Maleficent discovers his potential power and manipulates him into believing that Sora had forgotten and replaced him, stoking the inner darkness within Riku and turning him into an unwitting pawn despite his suspicions. Riku is later able to break free of the evil fairy's influence and decides to atone for his mistakes by sealing off the door to Kingdom Hearts along with King Mickey. His story did not end there, as he soon finds himself in Castle Oblivion's basement, having been guided there by Sora's heart. He takes this opportunity to continue assisting Sora from the shadows, but struggles with the darkness in his heart in spite of his attempts to embrace the light.",

The two inherited the powers of the Oni and the Dragon and trained under his father in the ways of Spinjitzu. After the corruption of Garmadon by the venom of The Great Devourer, Wu found himself more distant from his brother, though still on friendly terms, and along with his brother, took it upon himself to protect and safeguard The Golden Weapons after the death of his father. Many years later, his brother left to train under Master Chen, leaving the duty to him alone. Eventually, Wu met a young Morro, whom he found digging through his trash for food, and took pity on him, taking him in and training him in the Way of the. Ninja. Eventually, he found out that Morro was in actuality a descendant of the Master of Wind and believed him to be the foretold Green Ninja. However, this theory was found to be false when The Golden Weapons failed to react to Morro, who left the Monastery in anger and vowed to find The Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master, eventually suffocating to death in poison gas and becoming conscripted to The Cursed Realm for his crimes. Soon, however, Wu, found himself embroiled in The First Serpentine War, and alongside his brother and The Elemental Alliance, fought the Serpentine and defeated them using the sacred flute. Soon after, however, the Alliance and Wu were betrayed by the Masters of Time Krux and Acronix, who believed their power over the Element of Time made them superior to the other Elemental Masters. After being soundly defeated by the two, the group turned to the Masters of Water and Fire, Maya and Ray, who forged four blades of Chronosteel to absorb, and hold their power. As punishment, the Time Blades, as well as Krux and Acronix were scattered throughout time. Sometime after, Wu found himself facing his brother, whose corruption had finally fully manifested itself, over the weapons of their father, before accidentally killing him and sealing him in the underworld. In order to safeguard the Four Weapons, Wu hid the weapons in remote places and placed a dragon to guard each and gave the map to Ray and Maya. Many years later, Wu recruited the 4 ninja to help him protect the weapons against Garmadon’s army of Skulkin warriors, teaching them in the ways of Spinjitzu. Eventually, his nephew Lloyd and Kai’s Sister Nya joined the ranks of the ninja, who became Ninjago’s greatest heroes. Eventually, during a battle against the returned Krux and Acronix, Wu was lost in time, and was later found by the Sons of Garmadon, having been reverted to his infancy. Soon after, he was lost in The First Realm along with his students, and eventually regained his adulthood. Finding the legendary Dragon Armor, worn by his father in his youth, he gained the respect of The Firstbourne, and travelled back along with the ninja to fight the newly resurrected Garmadon.",

    "Summary": "The Golden Weapons were four weapons forged by The First Spinjitzu Master as a child in order to create his own world after his escape from The Realm of The Oni and the Dragon. The four weapons each contain the immense power of the four basic elements, and when used together can manipulate the Elemental Essence of Creation, which allows the user to create something out of nothing, and manipulate the four main elements and the secondary elements that make up the world. After their retrieval from their hiding places by the ninja, they were stolen by Lord Garmadon and reforged into the immensely powerful Mega Weapon, which sacrificed its destructive capabilities to grant the user wishes and power over reality. After being shot into space following Garmadon's plan to go back in time and change the past, both the past and present sets of weapons were forged into The Golden Armor by The Overlord in order to fuel the missing 1% of golden power necessary to become The Golden Master. After The Overlord's defeat, The Golden Armor was hidden by Cyrus Borg in Hiroshi's Labyrinth for safekeeping. However, after the assault on Ninjago by The Oni, they were reforged into the Golden Weapons by Kai, but were depowered after the ninjas including Wu and Garmadon used the Tornado of Creation. They were later taken by the Cystal Council and turned into the '''Weapons of Destruction''' by Aspheera, they were later reclaimed by the ninja and turned back into their original state as pure elemental energy becoming the Golden Ultra Dragon.",

    "Summary": "In the First Realm, only two races existed, the Oni, and the Dragons, beings who controlled creation and destruction, and who fought each other in an eternal stalemate. One day, however, a child who was born of both the Oni and the Dragon was born. This child, known as the First Spinjitzu Master, was sought by both races as a means to end the war. Seeing that the two races would never find peace and couldn't understand the balance that was necessary for existence, left the realm to create his own, which became known as Ninjago. However, as the balance dictates that a world must have both good and evil, the Overlord - the dark spirit that had always existed - emerged into the Realm. The First Spinjitzu Master and the Overlord fought tirelessly and endlessly until The Overlord created a stone army to finally kill him. Knowing that he would eventually lose, the First Spinjitzu Master split the land in two, the Overlord being sealed into The Dark Island. However, the Overlord saw the arrival of Lord Garmadon, and thus waited for the ultimate battle between good and evil. Eventually, his prediction came to pass, with Lord Garmadon being betrayed by the Serpentine and left to rot in the ocean, eventually landing on the island. Manipulating Lord Garmadon and starting the Celestial Clock's countdown, which would dictate the beginning of the battle, The Overlord tricked him into spreading darkness through the Garmatron into Ninjago, shifting the balance back to darkness and restoring his powers. Forcibly taking over Garmadon's body and regaining his true form, and proceeded to corrupt all of Ninjago. However, he was ultimately soundly defeated by Lloyd Garmadon, who had become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master and was purged from Ninjago. Unfortunately for the Ninjas, the site of his defeat was still a foothold for him to remain and allowed him to take over Borg Industries, whose headquarters were built upon it. Taking over New Ninjago City’s infrastructure and the entirety of their computer system, he began a campaign to drain Lloyd’s power in order to become the Golden Master, a legendary being of Serpentine lore who held the powers of The First Spinjitzu Master at his peak, and would be fated to enslave the world. Eventually fulfilling this role with the power of the Golden Weapons, the Overlord was defeated by Zane, who sacrificed himself to turn the Overlord’s power against himself at the cost of his own life, purging his darkness from Ninjago once more.",

    "Summary": "The Stone Army is a villain faction that opposed the Ninja in the second season of Ninjago. To defeat the First Spinjitzu Master, The Overlord decided to use refined Dark Matter to create an army of indestructible warriors, that could be controlled only with a special item: the Helmet of Shadows. Once they fought the Creator of Ninjago, the latter was completely overwhelmed, as the Warriors were completely indestructible and immune to his powers, but he managed to create an Elemental Blade, which negated their invulnerability and immunity. Despite this, the Overlord and his servants were still too much for the First Spinjitzu Master to handle, as they pushed him to split Ninjago in half, sealing the Overlord in one of the new two continents, which became the Island of Darkness, and banishing the remaining Warriors of the Stone Army in a prison underground. Thousands of years later, the Stone Army was reawakened by the Great Devourer's poison and escaped their prison, and after going on a rampage on Ninjago, they forced the Ninja to retreat and to go to the Temple of Light to find the other Elemental Blades to regain their powers and to defeat both the Army and the Overlord, which came to power again thanks to Lord Garmadon.",

    "Summary": "Xion is the fourteenth member of Organization XIII, first appearing in the game Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, in which she could be viewed as both a main protagonist and antagonist. She is not a normal Nobody and is only a nominal member of the Organization. Because of this, she does not have a throne in Where Nothing Gathers, nor does she have a title or a breed of Nobody to control. Instead, she is an imperfect Replica of Sora created from his leaked memories as a fail-safe in case both Sora and Roxas proved to be useless to Organization XIII's plans. While this enables her to use the Keyblade, Xion's existence also halts Sora's progression of regaining his memories to fully awaken while in his pod, something which Naminé, DiZ, and Riku recognize.",

Eventually, his father died and erased his memory to spare him the pain. Zane was then found by Sensei Wu and was made part of the ninja. Eventually learning of his origin during the Second Serpentine War[2] and reuniting with his father, who had been resurrected by the King of the Underworld[3], he unlocked his true potential[2] and eventually sacrificed himself to destroy The Golden Master[4]. However, his spirit lived on[4] and recreated his body in the form of The Titanium Ninja, stronger than ever before.",
