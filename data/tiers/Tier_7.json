A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. It can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is highly allergenic to humans and toxic to other Pokémon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey. It can also utilize these petals in its former signature move, Petal Dance. Vileplume lives in grassy plains, where it is often mistaken for local flowers.",

The power of this Pokémon’s uppercut is enough to send foes flying. Simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness.",

Vileplume's flower is said to have the largest petals in the world and is almost too heavy for the Pokémon itself to support. The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. It can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is highly allergenic to humans and toxic to other Pokémon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey. It can also utilize these petals in its former signature move, Petal Dance. Vileplume lives in grassy plains, where it is often mistaken for local flowers.",

Additionally, their 8\"/55 (203mm) main guns and secondary 5\"/38 (127mm) guns were regularly used to bombard land targets in support of amphibious landings. After the war, only six Baltimores and two Oregon City-class ships remained in service, while the rest were moved to the reserve fleet.",

Regardless, the character still steared closely to her creator's original idea, her origin story being given as that of an agent pertaining to a secret governmental organization nominated Alpha-13, who, in a mention with the objective of thwarting the supervillain Madame Atom's plan of detonating a nuclear drill within a Ziggurat holding vast amounts of divine power within itself, thus taking the elemental force of an unspecified Sumerian god unto her body and becoming the most powerful being in the Universe. Attempting to deactivate Atom's drill by hand, Caroline eventually ran low on time and the drill exploded within the Ziggurat, embuing her with the powerful magic contained in the construction and drastically mutating her appearance into that of an inorganic, blue-skinned chimeric humanoid, as a result granting her the power to fully control her own atomic structure, thus turning her into the titular Formless Girl.",

    "Summary": "The Cleveland-class light cruisers were built for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel originating from the base of a huge storm cloud, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a basal cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (480 km/h), are more than two miles (3 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).",

Regardless, the character still steared closely to her creator's original idea, her origin story being given as that of an agent pertaining to a secret governmental organization nominated Alpha-13, who, in a mention with the objective of thwarting the supervillain Madame Atom's plan of detonating a nuclear drill within a Ziggurat holding vast amounts of divine power within itself, thus taking the elemental force of an unspecified Sumerian god unto her body and becoming the most powerful being in the Universe. Attempting to deactivate Atom's drill by hand, Caroline eventually ran low on time and the drill exploded within the Ziggurat, embuing her with the powerful magic contained in the construction and drastically mutating her appearance into that of an inorganic, blue-skinned chimeric humanoid, as a result granting her the power to fully control her own atomic structure, thus turning her into the titular Formless Girl.",

    "Summary": "The Cleveland-class light cruisers were built for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

Eventually, she rebelled against the cult and escaped, but not without losing Jellal, who had been corrupted by Zeref's Dark Arts. She also served as the guild's 7th Guild Master during Makarov's absence in X792.",

    "PageURL": "https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Exeggutor",
    "Summary": "Exeggcute is a Pokémon resembling six light pink eggs, usually seen arranged with five heads huddled around a sixth. Each \"head\" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species. Exeggcute gathers in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pokémon as seen in the anime. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests.",

The tubes along its head-crest and tails are tipped with yellow, while the ones along its back have yellow semicircular patterns on either side. There are two yellow semicircle markings on its belly, but they are rarely seen due to its giant mouth. Its arms have three thin stripes below its elbow and three fingers. Each foot has four claws, three in the front and one in the back, and a yellow paw pad.",

    "Summary": "Gyarados is a Water/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It is the evolved form of Magikarp. Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

In actuality, sending him to Earth Land, along with all the other Exceed eggs, was done to allow him to escape a future disaster in Edolas. In X778, Natsu found Happy's egg in the East Forest of Magnolia Town. Natsu then took it back to the guild where he and Lisanna raised it together every day. One night, Elfman took it to keep it warm and the next day when he brought it back, it began to hatch and out popped a kitten with a pair of wings. Happy's first word was \"Aye.\" Natsu gave him the name \"Happy\" after Lisanna pointed out the change of the atmosphere from anger to happiness after Happy hatched from the egg. Despite everyone else seeing him as a cat, Natsu thought he was a Dragon.",

Yet lately, I'm plagued by the thought that the subject I know the least about is myself. That pieces of my history are missing. There remains only one truth that I know to be certain -- I am made to soar. I can't remember a life when I wasn't enthralled by flight. Open skies. Then why do I spend so much time underground? Darkness. Suffocating spaces. It's because the past is buried. And I'm swept up in the pursuit of it like a sparrow in a gale. Driven by the twin compulsions of my existence.

Because of his great powers, Alveus was banished to a barren planet. Alveus' worshipers founded a secret society with the sole purpose of bringing Hive back to Earth to conquer it. Over the centuries, that society evolved into HYDRA. Eventually, Alveus possessed Grant Ward's dead body when he was killed by Phil Coulson with his prosthetic hand on Maveth, and was able to return to Earth once more. Working with Gideon Malick, Alveus soon took the reins of HYDRA from him. Seeking to transform the Earth's population into Inhumans so they could live in peace, Hive and his small army attempted to use Kree blood to recreate the original experiments he had endured thousands of years earlier, kidnapping Holden Radcliffe in order to use his genius to complete his plans while battling the continued efforts of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Secret Warriors to stop him. As Hive attempted to complete his plan by detonating a warhead filled with Terrigen Mist into the Earth's atmosphere, he was defeated when Lincoln Campbell trapped himself and Hive with the bomb and allowed it to explode safely in space, destroying Alveus.",

After the war of the gods ended, they went to the depths of the ocean where they wished to never be bound by beings ever again and bring terror and ferocity on their own end. Whenever a Kraken attacks, nothing can stop it, warships and galleons vanish, ocean trade and communication is destroyed, and entire villages, towns, and cities are destroyed as a side effect if they desire to go onto land to nest. Some are even virtually gods that are worshiped and have cults and minions on land and sea, a Kraken pleased with its worshipers will becalm the sea and bring with it a plentiful amount of fish to the faithful. However, the devious mind of a Kraken is ancient and destructive, ultimately always bent to the devastation of all things.",

An exceedingly practical folk, they do not desire riches or knowledge that don't have use in normal day-to-day survival activities. Their people are hardy, and can adapt to most environments- so despite being dominated culturally by the likes of humans, dwarves, and elves, they rarely hold complaint for the lands leftover for their dominions.",

However, when the dragon was captured by the goblins who also lived in the same dungeon space (dubbed the Sunless Citadel), Meepo's reputation amongst his kin plummeted even lower, and he was destitute, until a party of adventurers arrived and assisted Meepo's tribe in re-capturing the dragon. This state of affairs lasted only briefly before the adventurers ultimately slew the dragon, killing all of Meepo's tribe as a consequence: only Meepo escaped.",

Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas. It is also one of few pokemon capable of Gigantamaxing.",

Due to a past incident involving the apparent death of her younger sister, Lisanna, Mirajane somehow lost much of her magical ability and her will to fight (both of which have since returned), and her personality changed drastically. Now, Mirajane is a loving and caring person who treats her friends, and even strangers, with kindness. Mirajane plays a motherly role within the guild, and is often seen running the bar at the guild hall.",

They stand at the forefront of the Abyss, guarding the entryways and passing judgement on all souls who happen to pass through to their afterlife. The ways of the Nalfeshnee are unknown, though most merely assume the Nalfeshnee picks at random whether a soul will be devoured, turned to a Dretch, or a Lemure. On extremely rare occasions the Nalfeshnee may hand-pick a particularly valuable soul and elevate it to a higher level of life immediately. Given the opportunity to fight, a Nalfeshnee is a brutal and unfair fighter, disabling enemies and then ripping them apart.",

The tails grow hot as it approaches evolution. Vulpix is capable of manipulating fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouths to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix can be found most commonly in grassy plains.",

However, he is not a caring trainer, what he wants from his Pokémon is pure power and the trainers he faces to be strong. When he first meets Ash, he demands a 3 on 3 Battle, however since Ash was still looking for Pikachu, Ash couldn't battle, this warranted some aggrivation on Paul's part. Paul is also known to release his Pokémon if he deems them weak or useless.",

Having lived and played with Mew, one day a hole opened up in the ground, and caused him to accidentally fall into a land called PokéPark. He learned that friendship there was basically dying, and as a result the Sky Prism had partially shattered, which could have eventually led to the Sky Pavilion falling on the PokéPark itself. Mew took this as an opportunity to test his friend and save PokéPark at the same time, manipulating events so that specific people, such as those running Attractions, came to find or were given the shards of the Sky Prism that Pikachu needed. Over the course of the game Pikachu gets stronger, tougher, and grows far beyond he ever thought possible, as he gains each Sky Prism shard and even saves the Park itself.",

    "Summary": "Mankey is a simian Pokémon, similar to a New World monkey. It is a bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig’s snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Along with Stufful, it is the smallest Fighting-type. Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, Mankey begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.",

Naming himself Rocket, he befriended fellow experiments Lylla, Teefs and Floor, with the four believing they would soon be allowed to live in peace on a new planet. Upon aiding High Evolutionary with a scientific problem, Rocket discovered that he, along with the previous experiments, were slated to be killed. Attempting to free his friends, he cried in horror as High Evolutionary killed Lylla, prompting him to attack his creator in a rage, which in turn caused Teefs and Floor’s deaths. Rocket then boarded a spaceship and fled into the cosmos.",

    "Summary": "Taliyah is a nomadic mage from Shurima who weaves stone with energetic enthusiasm and raw determination. Torn between teenage wonder and adult responsibility, she has crossed nearly all of Valoran on a journey to learn the true nature of her growing powers. Compelled by rumors of the rise of a long-dead emperor, she returns to protect her tribe from dangers uncovered by Shurima's shifting sands. Some have mistaken her tender heart for weakness and paid the price for their error, for beneath Taliyah's youthful demeanor is a will strong enough to move mountains, and a spirit fierce enough to make the Earth tremble.",

Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel originating from the base of a huge storm cloud, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a basal cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (480 km/h), are more than two miles (3 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).",

Underneath its chin is a bulbous red vocal sac, which is smaller on a female Toxicroak. It has three fingers and one large red claw on the back of each hand. These claws on the backs of their hands can channel poison. Its forearms have two black rings encircling them. Its legs are muscular and seem to be adapted for speedy attacks. It has three toes on its feet, with a red middle toe on each foot, and a sharp spike which juts out of its heels. Underneath the pelvic area are two white horizontal lines. Thick black lines run down the sides of its body and surrounding its limbs, making them seem as if the limbs are detachable. The black lines go up into its face and surround the eyes before meeting in the middle of its snout, just above the upper lip.",

Vileplume's flower is said to have the largest petals in the world and is almost too heavy for the Pokémon itself to support. The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. It can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is highly allergenic to humans and toxic to other Pokémon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey. It can also utilize these petals in its former signature move, Petal Dance. Vileplume lives in grassy plains, where it is often mistaken for local flowers.",

    "Summary": "Exeggcute is a Pokémon resembling six light pink eggs, usually seen arranged with five heads huddled around a sixth. Each \"head\" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species. Exeggcute gathers in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pokémon as seen in the anime. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests.",

Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

Years ago, when Happy was just an egg, he was taken away from his parents, Lucky and Marl, by the queen of Extalia, Shagotte, to carry out the Dragon Slayer assassination plan. In actuality, sending him to Earth Land, along with all the other Exceed eggs, was done to allow him to escape a future disaster in Edolas. In X778, Natsu found Happy's egg in the East Forest of Magnolia Town. Natsu then took it back to the guild where he and Lisanna raised it together every day. One night, Elfman took it to keep it warm and the next day when he brought it back, it began to hatch and out popped a kitten with a pair of wings. Happy's first word was \"Aye.\" Natsu gave him the name \"Happy\" after Lisanna pointed out the change of the atmosphere from anger to happiness after Happy hatched from the egg. Despite everyone else seeing him as a cat, Natsu thought he was a Dragon.",

Because of their gentle nature, this Pokémon rarely fights, and due to this, it has been caught and poached to near extinction, starting a conservation effort. It is known to sing an enchanting cry when in a good mood, but in the evenings, it sings plaintively as it seeks what few others of its kind remain. Thankfully, by the time of Sun and Moon, protective regulations have saved the species, so much that there's an overabundance in Alola.",

Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games always depict Meowth on two legs, the anime states that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas. It is also one of few pokemon capable of Gigantamaxing.",

On top of its head are three curled locks of orange fur with bangs, and it has six orange tails with curled tips. However, Vulpix is born with only a single, white tail. The tails grow hot as it approaches evolution. Vulpix is capable of manipulating fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouths to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix can be found most commonly in grassy plains.",

    "Summary": "Poliwhirl is a blue, bipedal Pokémon with a spherical body. It has bulbous eyes that protrude from the top of its head. A black and white swirl covers its belly, which is actually its organs showing through its thin skin. It appears to have white gloves on its hands and rounded, digit-less feet. When out of water, it sweats to keep its skin moist and healthy. This keeps it covered in an oily fluid that allows it to slip away from enemies. All of its skin feels this way except where its swirl is, which is instead very smooth. The swirl on its belly undulates slowly and staring at it induces drowsiness.",

Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Along with Stufful, it is the smallest Fighting-type. Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, Mankey begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.",

Sandslash is also adept at climbing trees and is prone to ambush its enemies from above. Sandslash can mostly be found in deserts.",

    "Summary": "Spiritomb is a Ghost and Dark Pokémon, basically based around the number 108. It was said to have been formed by 108 spirits, and sealed into the Odd Keystone for its misdeeds. Interesting things about this fact include the fact that despite the fact that most Pokédex entries point out to a singular Spiritomb, there happen to be many. Also, despite being a combination of 108 spirits, in which the likelihood of having all of the same gender is slim, it is not a genderless Pokémon. Prior to generation VI, it, along with Sableye, were noted to be the only Pokémon with no weaknesses.",

These claws on the backs of their hands can channel poison. Its forearms have two black rings encircling them. Its legs are muscular and seem to be adapted for speedy attacks. It has three toes on its feet, with a red middle toe on each foot, and a sharp spike which juts out of its heels. Underneath the pelvic area are two white horizontal lines. Thick black lines run down the sides of its body and surrounding its limbs, making them seem as if the limbs are detachable. The black lines go up into its face and surround the eyes before meeting in the middle of its snout, just above the upper lip.",

The species is known to be extremely territorial, claiming entire large ponds or swamps as its territory, and if it sees an enemy approaching, it can cause massive earthquakes that can be felt in a three mile radius, which also gave it the ability to sense when real earthquakes will occur. Whiscash are also known to possess extremely voracious appetites, eating anything it sees as long as it's alive.",

Among the yugoloths, they serve as lesser leaders and are renowned for their particular penchant for the arcane (hence their name). Arcanaloths have an in-depth sense of style that counteracts against their jackal-like appearance, which most consider off-putting; thus, most arcanaloths, if caught in negotiations, will transform into a more fitting humanoid shape, with a charming smile and glint in their eye.",

It is also said to have nerves of steel, and that it's more agile and active than it appears. It evolves at level 15 into the Normal-/Water- type Bibarel (Japanese: ビーダル Beadaru), the Beaver Pokémon. The Pokédex knows it as a Pokémon that is really good at building dams and is a swimmer as fast as a Feebas, though slow on land. Trainers know it as the Pokémon that can learn the most HMs. Back in Gen IV, it used to have a signature ability in Unaware.",

Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species. Exeggcute gathers in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pokémon as seen in the anime. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests.",

Thus, in contrast with their fun-loving species, the Ghaele's hearts were heavy, and many considered them distant and cold. The Ghaele would often wander the Prime Material, loving the place and growing depressed if they were unable to speak to the mortals of the realm.",

Not unlike maggots or Carrion Crawlers, they sweep to the scent of freshly killed flesh in droves to devour and consume. The first ghoul was made when Doresain, an elf worshiper of Orcus, consumed human flesh. As a reward, Orcus granted him a domain in his layer of the Abyss- however, this was lost when Yeenoghu overthrew Doresain. When Orcus failed to act on his behalf, Doresain turned back to the elf gods, who saved him from total annihilation once more.",

However, when the dragon was captured by the goblins who also lived in the same dungeon space (dubbed the Sunless Citadel), Meepo's reputation amongst his kin plummeted even lower, and he was destitute, until a party of adventurers arrived and assisted Meepo's tribe in re-capturing the dragon. This state of affairs lasted only briefly before the adventurers ultimately slew the dragon, killing all of Meepo's tribe as a consequence: only Meepo escaped.",

Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers.

It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using Pay Day. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence. At least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas. It is also one of few pokemon capable of Gigantamaxing.",

These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouths to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix can be found most commonly in grassy plains.",

The mushrooms can be removed at any time and grow from spores that are doused on this Pokémon's back at birth by the mushroom on its mother's back. Tochukaso are parasitic in nature, drawing their nutrients from the host Paras's body in order to grow and exerting some command over the Pokémon's actions. For example, Paras drains nutrients from tree roots due to commands from the mushrooms. The mushrooms are also popular among collectors and have medicinal uses, usually involving extended life.",

Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, Mankey begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.",

During his time as head Wyrmspeaker, Severin reformed the cult's core belief systems, turning from the previous fascination with dracoliches to living, breathing dragons. To help with this goal, he sought to summon Tiamat from her prison in Avernus, as well as her temple. In doing so, he forged alliances with several noteworthy organizations- most notably the Red Wizards of Thay, a magical organization he sought to use for the ritual he devised to summon the Dragon Queen.",

Talonflame has a pointed crest atop its head and a black and yellow mask-like pattern around its eyes. Its black beak is hooked with a yellow cere. It also has long black tail-feathers marked with three yellow \"v\"-shapes. The tail ends in two points and has another feather sticking out of the base on each side, giving the impression of the fletching on the end of an arrow.",

Underneath its chin is a bulbous red vocal sac, which is smaller on a female Toxicroak. It has three fingers and one large red claw on the back of each hand. These claws on the backs of their hands can channel poison. Its forearms have two black rings encircling them. Its legs are muscular and seem to be adapted for speedy attacks. It has three toes on its feet, with a red middle toe on each foot, and a sharp spike which juts out of its heels. Underneath the pelvic area are two white horizontal lines. Thick black lines run down the sides of its body and surrounding its limbs, making them seem as if the limbs are detachable. The black lines go up into its face and surround the eyes before meeting in the middle of its snout, just above the upper lip.",

From that day forward, Ulmo was a stalwart of his god, and became known as an Exalted Hero.",

As the leaders of a people dedicated towards deception, ultroloths are paranoid and often fight amongst themselves when a greater, united front is not available. While rarely does this result in something so un-subtle as outright betrayal and murder, often it does mean constant shifting of offices among their members.",

A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. It can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is highly allergenic to humans and toxic to other Pokémon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey. It can also utilize these petals in its former signature move, Petal Dance. Vileplume lives in grassy plains, where it is often mistaken for local flowers.",

The species is known to be extremely territorial, claiming entire large ponds or swamps as its territory, and if it sees an enemy approaching, it can cause massive earthquakes that can be felt in a three mile radius, which also gave it the ability to sense when real earthquakes will occur. Whiscash are also known to possess extremely voracious appetites, eating anything it sees as long as it's alive.",

The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

It also finally made Skurge a hero of Asgard rather than a villain.",

Because of his great powers, Alveus was banished to a barren planet. Alveus' worshipers founded a secret society with the sole purpose of bringing Hive back to Earth to conquer it. Over the centuries, that society evolved into HYDRA. Eventually, Alveus possessed Grant Ward's dead body when he was killed by Phil Coulson with his prosthetic hand on Maveth, and was able to return to Earth once more. Working with Gideon Malick, Alveus soon took the reins of HYDRA from him. Seeking to transform the Earth's population into Inhumans so they could live in peace, Hive and his small army attempted to use Kree blood to recreate the original experiments he had endured thousands of years earlier, kidnapping Holden Radcliffe in order to use his genius to complete his plans while battling the continued efforts of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Secret Warriors to stop him. As Hive attempted to complete his plan by detonating a warhead filled with Terrigen Mist into the Earth's atmosphere, he was defeated when Lincoln Campbell trapped himself and Hive with the bomb and allowed it to explode safely in space, destroying Alveus.",

Ironhide did not understand what the Cube was going to be used for if not for subjugation, and Optimus informed him it was to spread \"freedom\". In gratitude, Ironhide spoke to his commanders about building a temple to house the AllSpark.",

The fact he's hoping to replace that with Decepticon tyranny isn't really a concern... to him, at least. A fanatic at spark, he revels in every Autobot who suffers at Decepticon hands and doesn't register beings like humans as anything more than \"collateral damage.\"",

However, he faced opposition from the non-believer Thetacons, and Shockwave joined Megatron, Optimus, and several others in repelling their attacks. Ultimately, Sentinel Prime won the day, as he and Wheeljack were successful in locating the lost AllSpark and harnessing a new sun to orbit. This, however, did not please Shockwave. Now that the war was over, he was dissatisfied, and he no longer knew his purpose. This shocked his old friend, Megatron, and Shockwave explained that it was the journey he enjoyed, not the destination. Plus, well, that new sun was kind of bright.",

He is one of the longest running primary adversaries of the series as well as the first enemy to hand Luffy a complete and utter defeat, not once but twice. He secretly formed a criminal organization called Baroque Works, whose public aim was to take over the prosperous of Alabasta and create a utopia and led it as its president. To accomplish this, he worked to undermine Alabasta King's influence by defeating criminals before the royal army could, and by exploiting a drought in order to pit the kingdom against an army of rebels. His Devil Fruit, the Sand-Sand Fruit (Suna Suna no Mi), lets him turn into and control sand, a very useful ability in the desert kingdom.",

The organization would end up at odds with XOF, the covert strike force of the shadow government known as The Patriots, due to the feud between Big Boss/Venom Snake and XOF's leader, Skull Face. Ultimately, Diamond Dogs would emerge victorious, with Venom Snake and Kazuhira Miller dealing the finishing blows to Skull Face and scattering XOF. The PMC would remain in operation for roughly a decade more, before being supplanted and its strength absorbed by Big Boss' military fortress nation, Outer Heaven.",

Dying of old age, the king latched onto Homunculus' promises of immortality, and helped him set up a country-wide transmutation circle, being told that it would bring him eternal life by draining the souls of the entire country within him. However, Homunculus had set up the circle in such a way that the souls would flow into him and Hohenheim instead, killing the king and destroying Xerxes in one night.",

He has eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which gives him stretching powers that he has become quite a master of and he's quite creative with them as he has developed two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack.",

However, the Homunculus, grateful for the blood that brought him into the world and the unwavering friendship, bestowed upon the slave the gifts of a proper name, education, freedom, and ultimately, a body that never decays. Nevertheless, the freed slave, now known as Hohenheim, strongly condemned the gift of immortality that cost countless lives. Since then, Hohenheim has turned bitterly against Homunculus, sworn to end his agonizing immortality, and set free all the souls trapped within their bodies. Likewise, to prevent a similar tragedy from ever happening again.",

I just couldn't ever forgive those who acted as if that value didn't exist. Sukuna... I loathe you. Humans aren't tools. We aren't born with any set role. Which is to say... I don't know.

(This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",

As such, he has disguised himself as an Earth police car in an attempt to fool the humans around him.",

When given a target he hunts it down with fierce determination. Blackout is not happy with the progress Starscream is making towards finding the missing Decepticon leader. He suspects (quite rightly) that Starscream would prefer Megatron to stay lost. Blackout is openly mutinous and will challenge Starscream's leadership at any opportunity, not for his own sake, but to better serve his ultimate goal of finding his lost master. Blackout has a sneaky side and uses his symbiotic companion Scorponok's small size to great advantage.",

He hates everyone and everything, be they Autobot, Decepticon, or anything in-between—he even hates himself, revolted by his misshapen, hunchbacked robot mode, which he considers a reflection of all the ugliness and malice inside himself. The full force of this vicious cycle of hatred finds release in explosive frenzied bursts of psychotic brutality, as Bonecrusher takes out the full force of his bitterness and self-loathing on anyone who looks at him sideways. He hates that. He also hates Megatron, but would hate being terminated by the Decepticon leader more, so he sticks around.",

Though he's neither a brainiac nor a fast runner, Bulkhead is one of the most sturdy members of Team Prime. He's afraid of hurting things smaller and more fragile than him, but his new human friend, Miko Nakadai, has helped him grow past that. He has a low tolerance for jerks and is quite happy to let people like that stew in the trouble they've made for themselves, but his better impulses—or at least, needling from those around him—always sway him into helping in the end. For all his sweetness, he's still a Wrecker through and through. Yet despite participating in several major battles and campaigns, his past career has left some painful psychological scars. Being a part of the Autobots' black ops team means you have to do the dirty work, and Bulkhead's seen many horrors and friends meet a bad end. Though saddened by his traumatic experiences with the Wreckers, he's joined up with Optimus Prime to end the fight with Megatron, for the sake of all his brothers and comrades.",

He and Cliffjumper were guardians of the AllSpark at the Temple of Simfur. During the war, Bumblebee was placed in command of a small Autobot unit at the AllSpark's hiding place in Tyger Pax, on the assumption that the Decepticon would focus their attention on Simfur; unfortunately, Megatron sensed the AllSpark's true location, and Bumblebee and his men found themselves under attack by the Decepticon leader and his troops. Swindle tried and failed to torture the AllSpark's precise hiding spot out of Bumblebee, forcing Megatron to take up the task, but even 'Bee did not know exactly where it was—moments later, both he and Megatron could only watch as the cube was blasted into space from a launch site nearby. A furious Megatron crushed Bumblebee's voice capacitor beyond repair in a petty act of revenge and took off after the AllSpark; although the young bot survived and was dubbed a hero for his actions, he feared that all the Autobots had done was potentially spread their war to other worlds.",

    "Summary": "All humans make mistakes. Sometimes, what comes from those mistakes comes the best thing that ever happened to them. That's what Cade Yeager believes when he looks at his daughter, to whom he and his girlfriend gave birth at the cost of their high school graduation. While Cade is not the most responsible father in the world, his most redeeming quality is that when it comes to keeping his daughter safe, he does not go back on his word, no matter what; a promise he made to his bride before she passed away. He does have a creative and optimistic mind, lending it to building all kinds of inventions to make a good business out of. Sadly, none of these inventions have brought in much profit for his family. Knowing all of the opportunities he lost, he has sworn not to let history repeat itself, which is probably why he disapproves of Tessa dating boys before she graduates from high school.",

Dying of old age, the king latched onto Homunculus' promises of immortality, and helped him set up a country-wide transmutation circle, being told that it would bring him eternal life by draining the souls of the entire country within him. However, Homunculus had set up the circle in such a way that the souls would flow into him and Hohenheim instead, killing the king and destroying Xerxes in one night.",

    "Summary": "Metal Gear Sahelanthropus is a Metal Gear featured in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Created by Huey Emmerich and funded by the Soviet Union, Sahelanthropus was in actuality a project overseen by XOF, the covert strike force and at-the-time usurper of the shadow government known as The Patriots. Encountered by Venom Snake several times in Afghanistan, he managed to best the machine multiple times, eventually capturing it after the death of Skull Face, the leader of XOF. Snake kept it at Mother Base for some time, until it was stolen by Eli with the help of the Third Child, who took it to Central Africa, where he, the remnants of XOF and Venom Snake with his Diamond Dogs private military company, fought to reclaim the weapon. Snake eventually won the day, but Sahelanthropus was destroyed in battle.",

Optimus grew up with no knowledge of who he was, and was eventually found by Sentinel Prime, who claimed to be descended from Primus himself. Joining Sentinel's tribe of \"Autobots\", Optimus worked with his teacher and other pupils Megatron and Elita-One to restore order to an energy-starved Cybertron by helping to locate the lost AllSpark, buried far beneath Cybertron's surface. Re-energized by a star harnessed by the science of Wheeljack, the AllSpark restored life and energy to Cybertron, unifying the planet once more, but the old and weary Sentinel Prime had no desire to lead this new, united populace. At last, he revealed to Optimus the secret of his heritage, and that he, as \"Optimus Prime\", ought to succeed him as leader.",

The AllSpark had been buried somewhere within Cybertron and been dismissed as a legend, and the planet itself lacked a star to orbit. As energy became more and more scarce, Cybertronians segregated into tribes. Shockwave chose to rally behind Sentinel Prime, who claimed to be descended from Primus himself. However, he faced opposition from the non-believer Thetacons, and Shockwave joined Megatron, Optimus, and several others in repelling their attacks. Ultimately, Sentinel Prime won the day, as he and Wheeljack were successful in locating the lost AllSpark and harnessing a new sun to orbit. This, however, did not please Shockwave. Now that the war was over, he was dissatisfied, and he no longer knew his purpose. This shocked his old friend, Megatron, and Shockwave explained that it was the journey he enjoyed, not the destination. Plus, well, that new sun was kind of bright.",

Due to conspiratorial acts at the top of government, Kimblee is officially exonerated of his crimes so as to serve as the Führer's hidden left hand in the secret battles to come.",

    "Summary": "Usopp serves as the crew's sharpshooter and previously served as the (barely competent) repairman for the ship. He's the son of Yasopp, a sharpshooter serving under Shanks, and comes from the East Blue. Usopp had a reputation on his home island of being a serial liar who claimed that pirates were attacking, which came back to haunt him when real pirates actually attacked. He's a rather boastful seventeen/nineteen-year-old who likes to tell tall tales (several of which actually do come true, after a fashion), though he's more prone to hiding behind the stronger crew members such as Zoro when he actually gets into a fight. However, when push comes to shove, he is very dependable. He specializes in the use of a slingshot, called the Galaxy Slingshot (Ginga Pachinko), which he replaced with the Kabuto and later the Black Kabuto. This slingshot, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies, and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.",

However, when interacting with Weiss, she smiles and shows that she cares about her younger sister's life and well-being. Although she strives to keep her emotions in check, she can be rather hot-headed at times. Once she becomes angry, she drops her dignified ladylike demeanor and loses all restraint. Winter consistently wrestles with her emotions, never letting them overpower her, yet still allowing them to guide her on what she believes to be a righteous path.",

    "Summary": "Even as the prince of the Fire Nation, Zuko has always struggled in life, particularly in matching his prodigy sister Azula and getting his father's acknowledgment. This came to a head when Ozai punished him for a perceived slight by horrifically burning his face and sending him into exile, refusing to let him return until he had captured the Avatar. (This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",

It is later revealed that her father, the Flame King, put her there on Princess Bubblegum's advice when she was an infant, and she did not come out for 14 years. She has a short temper, trust issues, and a heat core that can destroy the world if overblown with emotions.",

He was formerly a member of a criminal shipbreaking gang called the Franky Family, which operated in the shipbuilders' haven of Water 7. He encountered the Straw Hats when he and the Franky Family brutally beat Usopp and stole a great deal of money from the crew while they were attempting to get their boat fixed on the island. However, his interests subsequently aligned with the Straw Hats' when the secret government organization CP9 kidnapped both him and their crewmate Nico Robin in a bid to construct the ancient superweapon Pluton, which he owned the blueprints to. After escaping the clutches of CP9, Franky decided to join their crew, drawn by their dedication to both their ship and their fellow crewmen.",

While other Decepticons get by on greed, ambition, or just their fondness for dispensing chaos, Bonecrusher is fueled by sheer, unrelenting hate. He hates everyone and everything, be they Autobot, Decepticon, or anything in-between—he even hates himself, revolted by his misshapen, hunchbacked robot mode, which he considers a reflection of all the ugliness and malice inside himself. The full force of this vicious cycle of hatred finds release in explosive frenzied bursts of psychotic brutality, as Bonecrusher takes out the full force of his bitterness and self-loathing on anyone who looks at him sideways. He hates that. He also hates Megatron, but would hate being terminated by the Decepticon leader more, so he sticks around.",

He and Cliffjumper were guardians of the AllSpark at the Temple of Simfur. During the war, Bumblebee was placed in command of a small Autobot unit at the AllSpark's hiding place in Tyger Pax, on the assumption that the Decepticon would focus their attention on Simfur; unfortunately, Megatron sensed the AllSpark's true location, and Bumblebee and his men found themselves under attack by the Decepticon leader and his troops. Swindle tried and failed to torture the AllSpark's precise hiding spot out of Bumblebee, forcing Megatron to take up the task, but even 'Bee did not know exactly where it was—moments later, both he and Megatron could only watch as the cube was blasted into space from a launch site nearby. A furious Megatron crushed Bumblebee's voice capacitor beyond repair in a petty act of revenge and took off after the AllSpark; although the young bot survived and was dubbed a hero for his actions, he feared that all the Autobots had done was potentially spread their war to other worlds.",

He does have a creative and optimistic mind, lending it to building all kinds of inventions to make a good business out of. Sadly, none of these inventions have brought in much profit for his family. Knowing all of the opportunities he lost, he has sworn not to let history repeat itself, which is probably why he disapproves of Tessa dating boys before she graduates from high school.",

When the demon lord came back to life, he started gathering powerful souls in the newly created Majigen to fulfill his own plans. Q-Bee noticed this vast amount of souls and headed there, in order to satisfy her hunger and that of her hive, as the sole interests of the Soul Bees are feeding, reproducing and expanding their colony.",

Raven has a high \"survival of the fittest\" mentality in which she is rather indifferent towards innocents dying if they were too weak to defend themselves. On one occasion she saved the life of her daughter, who she had abandoned shortly after her birth, though not without warning that she won't be looking out for her a second time. Raven is currently concerned about Salem and the power that she possesses.",

    "Summary": "Usopp serves as the crew's sharpshooter and previously served as the (barely competent) repairman for the ship. He's the son of Yasopp, a sharpshooter serving under Shanks, and comes from the East Blue. Usopp had a reputation on his home island of being a serial liar who claimed that pirates were attacking, which came back to haunt him when real pirates actually attacked. He's a rather boastful seventeen/nineteen-year-old who likes to tell tall tales (several of which actually do come true, after a fashion), though he's more prone to hiding behind the stronger crew members such as Zoro when he actually gets into a fight. However, when push comes to shove, he is very dependable. He specializes in the use of a slingshot, called the Galaxy Slingshot (Ginga Pachinko), which he replaced with the Kabuto and later the Black Kabuto. This slingshot, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies, and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.",

Despite being the eldest child, Winter's right to inherit the Schnee Dust Company was abdicated upon her decision to join the Atlas Military. At first glance, Winter appears to be cold, dignified, and distant, preferring to keep her emotions subdued and speaking in a very high-class, eloquent, almost robotic fashion. However, when interacting with Weiss, she smiles and shows that she cares about her younger sister's life and well-being. Although she strives to keep her emotions in check, she can be rather hot-headed at times. Once she becomes angry, she drops her dignified ladylike demeanor and loses all restraint. Winter consistently wrestles with her emotions, never letting them overpower her, yet still allowing them to guide her on what she believes to be a righteous path.",

    "Summary": "Toph Beifong is an earthbending master, one of the most powerful of her time, and the discoverer of metalbending. Blind since birth, Toph was constantly treated condescendingly because of her disability, particularly by her overprotective parents, Lao and Poppy Beifong. Upon discovering badgermoles, earthbending animals who were also blind, she learned how to use earthbending as an extension of her senses. This gave her the ability to \"see\" every vibration that passes through the ground. She became Avatar Aang's earthbending teacher.",

    "Summary": "Even as the prince of the Fire Nation, Zuko has always struggled in life, particularly in matching his prodigy sister Azula and getting his father's acknowledgment. This came to a head when Ozai punished him for a perceived slight by horrifically burning his face and sending him into exile, refusing to let him return until he had captured the Avatar. (This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",
