He was originally the leader of The Five Inversions, having joined the group after escaping the genocide committed by the Manhunters and watching them kill his family, and thereupon established the Empire of Tears that spanned a great swathe of space, until their eventual imprisonment and defeat. Atrocitus, however, convinced Abin Sur to free him by using his knowledge of the prophecy of the Blackest Night--later manipulating Abin Sur into experiencing fear, and ultimately mortally wounding Abin Sur, directly causing the events that would lead to Hal Jordan becoming the new Green Lantern of his Sector. Later, on Ysmault, he performed a blood ritual, slaying three of the four Inversions and using their blood to create the first Red Power Battery and ring. He then christened the battery in the last Inversion's blood, thus establishing the Red Lantern Corps.",

A Russian mutant, the character is a member of the X-Men, and is by far the physically strongest member of the team, being able to transform into a strong metallic form. Even without his powers he holds a physically imposing figure standing at 6' 7\" (200 cm). Throughout the series, he has been portrayed as a quiet, honest and innocent man. He has had a fairly consistent presence in X-Men-related comic books since his debut. A talented artist, he only reluctantly agrees to use his powers in combat, feeling it is his responsibility to use his abilities for the betterment of human and mutant-kind.",

He learned that friendship there was basically dying, and as a result the Sky Prism had partially shattered, which could have eventually led to the Sky Pavilion falling on the PokéPark itself. Mew took this as an opportunity to test his friend and save PokéPark at the same time, manipulating events so that specific people, such as those running Attractions, came to find or were given the shards of the Sky Prism that Pikachu needed. Over the course of the game Pikachu gets stronger, tougher, and grows far beyond he ever thought possible, as he gains each Sky Prism shard and even saves the Park itself.",

    "Summary": "Atrocitus is a Red Lantern and an enemy of the Guardians of the Universe, and the Sinestro Corps. He was originally the leader of The Five Inversions, having joined the group after escaping the genocide committed by the Manhunters and watching them kill his family, and thereupon established the Empire of Tears that spanned a great swathe of space, until their eventual imprisonment and defeat. Atrocitus, however, convinced Abin Sur to free him by using his knowledge of the prophecy of the Blackest Night--later manipulating Abin Sur into experiencing fear, and ultimately mortally wounding Abin Sur, directly causing the events that would lead to Hal Jordan becoming the new Green Lantern of his Sector. Later, on Ysmault, he performed a blood ritual, slaying three of the four Inversions and using their blood to create the first Red Power Battery and ring. He then christened the battery in the last Inversion's blood, thus establishing the Red Lantern Corps.",

Having lived and played with Mew, one day a hole opened up in the ground, and caused him to accidentally fall into a land called PokéPark. He learned that friendship there was basically dying, and as a result the Sky Prism had partially shattered, which could have eventually led to the Sky Pavilion falling on the PokéPark itself. Mew took this as an opportunity to test his friend and save PokéPark at the same time, manipulating events so that specific people, such as those running Attractions, came to find or were given the shards of the Sky Prism that Pikachu needed. Over the course of the game Pikachu gets stronger, tougher, and grows far beyond he ever thought possible, as he gains each Sky Prism shard and even saves the Park itself.",

Despite her turbulent youth, she was the first to defend both dragons and unicorns when the trolls began hunting them, unleashing her ferocity in a brilliant and powerful rainbow that could be seen throughout many regions of Skylands. From that day forward, evil-doers would quake when dark clouds brewed, and run from the rainbow that followed the storm.",

Seeing what the Makai had became in his absence, creating the Majigen pocket dimension to enact his plan to lure those he considered worthy, Jedah convinced himself that he must wipe out all realms of existence and fuse all souls into a single perfect being: the Shintai.",

Its goal is the absorption of the World of Trophy into Subspace, done by the usage of Subspace Bombs. As Tabuu cannot leave Subspace, most of the forces are located in the World of Trophy while Tabuu manipulates them from Subspace. Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",

It is the main antagonistic force of the Subspace Emissary, acting as the source behind most threats faced by the heroes. Its goal is the absorption of the World of Trophy into Subspace, done by the usage of Subspace Bombs. As Tabuu cannot leave Subspace, most of the forces are located in the World of Trophy while Tabuu manipulates them from Subspace. Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",
