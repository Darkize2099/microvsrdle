    "Summary": "The 16\"/50 (40.6 cm) caliber gun Mark 7 was the main armament of the Iowa-class battleships. This was possibly the best battleship gun ever put into service. Originally intended to fire the relatively light 2240 pound (1016 kg) AP Mark 5 projectile, the shell handling system for these guns was redesigned to use the \"super-heavy\" 2700 pound (1224.7 kg) AP Mark 8 before any of the USS Iowa class (BB-61) battleships were laid down.",

    "Summary": "The 6\"/47 (15.2 cm) caliber gun Mark 16 was a feature of many US Navy light cruisers during World War II. These guns were used to arm the Brooklyn- and Cleveland-class light cruisers, the latter being the most numerous class of cruisers ever built. The 6\"/47 caliber gun was one of several weapons developed by the United States Navy in the 1930s to fire \"super-heavy\" armor-piercing projectiles, thus increasing warships' destructive power while complying with the limits on bore diameter set by the London Naval Treaty. Compared with the previous 6\"/53 caliber guns, the 6\"/47 Mark 16 fired a 59 kilogram (130 pounds) projectile instead of a 48 kilogram (105 pounds) projectile. These new projectiles had almost double the penetration performance when compared against the older 6\"/53 (15.2 cm) AP projectiles used for the Omaha class (CL-4) light cruisers.",

The ritual for creating such a creature is relatively unknown- merely placing the brain in the correct fluids will not produce any of the same effects. Only those with enough control over the brain commit such rituals, as the brain is adept at taking control of the thoughts of others.",

    "Summary": "The Cleveland-class light cruisers were built for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

    "Summary": "Crawling Claws are the dismembered hands of murderous humanoids, animated by evil spellcasters to continue the slaughter they wrought in life. Essentially, a ritual is done to place the soul of a creature in the severed hand, allowing it to work as a laborer for evil casters. Notably, these evil beings are immune to the powers of others concerning undead- and indeed, since their soul is totally under the supervision of their caster, they cannot be affected by such powers, making them ideal servants.",

His savagery while serving in the US black-ops earned him the nickname Erik Killmonger. Years after T'Chaka killed his father for betraying Wakanda, Killmonger then planned to forcibly dethrone T'Challa in order to accomplish his father's plan to use Wakanda's technology to conquer the world via imperialistic, supremacist, world-spanning, and likely genocidal warfare, to stop what he perceived to be the oppression of people of African descent by the world. Manipulating and then killing Ulysses Klaue to gain access to their city, Killmonger seemingly killed T'Challa during ritual combat and took the throne, but just before Killmonger unleashed his plan, the Black Panther had returned and challenged Killmonger, eventually killing him in their final battle.",

Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

Hydras are famed for their unending hunger, for their sickening gluttony that often leads each head to turn on each other, devouring itself alive. Many warriors would hunt down and kill a Hydra in order to prove their strength.",

Joining the U.S. Marine Corps by adulthood, he became close friends with Francis \"Frank\" Castle, but they were both recruited into Operation Cerberus, a secret illegal military drug trafficking scheme in Afghanistan which resulted in the murder of an Afghan police officer and the deaths of numerous soldiers, ostensibly to help win the war. After returning home, Billy (who now owned a private military firm) was hired by the operation's ringleader to cover up the campaign by killing all involved personnel still alive, including Frank (now known as \"the Punisher\"), but the conspiracy was ultimately foiled and Russo's face was violently mutilated during a fight with his former friend, before being arrested.",

Many soldiers claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has \"acquired\" every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the veracity of the details is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his untrusty steed, Skaarl, Kled fights to protect what's his...and to take whatever he can get.",

    "Summary": "Merrow are abyssal aquatic creatures created from fiendishly altered Merfolk. They are spawns of Demogorgon, and serve him as underwater bullies intent on murdering other more wholesome sea-life for the pure sake of chaos. The territory of merrow can generally be identified by their habit of tying corpses to kelp at the boundaries of their underwater dominions. Originally, the merrow were created when a tribe of merfolk opened a portal into the Abyss after a blood sacrifice. Over several generations they transformed into the insane abominations they are now.",

The Bf 109 first saw operational service in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II in 1945. It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It was commonly called the Me 109, most often by Allied aircrew and among the German aces, even though this was not the official German designation.",

    "Summary": "Myconids are fungal organisms typically found in the Underdark that tend toward a pacifistic bent, and are generally more interested in enlightenment than combat. However, they are known to take up campaigns against the more vile races of the Underdark (such as the drow, duergar, mind flayers, and beholders) if threatened enough. They are known to make use of corpses as servants, infecting them with their spores to make them ambulatory once more. Myconids gather in \"circles\", small communities typically led by an individual of particular prowess and wisdom known as a sovereign. Myconids in such communities tend to form melds, a sort of group consciousness created via spores telepathically linking each and every member of the community. While in the meld, myconids release hallucinatory spores that grant dream-like visions that carry the primary function of entertainment or socializing, but can and are used to communicate complex ideas or memories.",

    "Summary": "Prometheus is a twisted mirror version of Batman. His parents were hippies inspired by the Bonnie and Clyde movie to become criminals. Eventually, they got cornered by the police and gunned down in front of their son. On that night, he swore he would take his revenge on the system and kill as many forces of justice as he could. He traveled around the world, training and studying, preparing himself to the day he would emerge as Prometheus. On his adult years, he met a group of Tibetan monks who worshipped evil. After gaining their trust, they gave him a Cosmic Key, a gateway to the dimension formally known as the Phantom Zone. There, he built his base and crafted the tools he needed to fight the Justice League.",

    "Summary": "The Rheinmetall 120mm gun is a smoothbore tank gun designed and produced by the West German Rheinmetall-DeTec AG company, developed in response to Soviet advances in armor technology and development of new armored threats. Production began in 1974, with the first version of the gun, known as the L/44 as it was 44 calibers long, used on the German Leopard 2 tank and soon produced under license for the American M1A1 Abrams and other tanks. The 120-millimeter gun has a length of 5.28 meters, and the gun system weighs approximately 3,317 kilograms. A variety of ammunition has been developed for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warhead warheads. Recent ammunition includes a wide range of new anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions, giving tanks armed with the L/44 and its derivatives greater versatility on the modern battlefield. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armor and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.",

While this habit constantly leads to the aptly named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavors, his puzzle-problem actually stems not only from his own narcissism and ego, but also from a deep-seeded psychological compulsion.

To Tasthania's astonishment, the unicorn healed it- the elf was enraged as the orc fled. Years later, she had been ambushed by orcs in the same forest- however, she was spared, as the chieftain of the warband was the same orc the unicorn had spared in her village. This caused Tasthania to have an epiphany, and led to her completely changing her worldview- now, she is totally devoted to the redemption of the orcish people, and counts many of those redeemed amongst her closest friends.",

Due to his successful operations around the world, Walker was chosen to succeed Steve Rogers as the second Captain America. However, his aspirations of living up to Rogers' legacy attracted the ire of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes in their pursuit of the Flag Smashers, during which he took the Super Soldier Serum after failing to apprehend Karli Morgenthau. When his partner and best friend Lemar Hoskins was killed in action, Walker brutally murdered a surrendering foreign national in public, leading to him being stripped of his mantle and discharged from the United States Army with total loss of rank. Walker confronted Morgenthau again in New York City but chose to abandon his revenge to join Wilson and Barnes in thwarting her attack on the GRC. Despite his discharge, Walker was recruited by government agent Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to continue serving America in secret as U.S. Agent.",

It was the first of the so-called \"Vengeance weapons\" series (V-weapons or Vergeltungswaffen), developed at Peenemünde Army Research Center in 1939 by the Nazi German Luftwaffe at the beginning of the Second World War, and was deployed at bombarding England. The thousands of V-1 missiles launched into England were fired from launch facilities along the French (Pas-de-Calais) and Dutch coasts. The existence of such a concept as cruise missile inspired the British to operate an arrangement of air defenses, including anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft, to intercept the bombs before they reached their targets, while the launch sites and underground storage depots became targets for Allied attacks including strategic bombing.",

These guns were used to arm the Brooklyn- and Cleveland-class light cruisers, the latter being the most numerous class of cruisers ever built. The 6\"/47 caliber gun was one of several weapons developed by the United States Navy in the 1930s to fire \"super-heavy\" armor-piercing projectiles, thus increasing warships' destructive power while complying with the limits on bore diameter set by the London Naval Treaty. Compared with the previous 6\"/53 caliber guns, the 6\"/47 Mark 16 fired a 59 kilogram (130 pounds) projectile instead of a 48 kilogram (105 pounds) projectile. These new projectiles had almost double the penetration performance when compared against the older 6\"/53 (15.2 cm) AP projectiles used for the Omaha class (CL-4) light cruisers.",

    "Summary": "The Accuracy International Arctic Warfare rifle is a bolt-action sniper rifle designed and manufactured by the British company Accuracy International. It has proved popular as a civilian, police, and military rifle since its introduction in the 1980s. The rifles have some features that improve performance in very cold conditions (which gave the rifle its name), without impairing operation in less extreme conditions. Arctic Warfare rifles are generally fitted with a Schmidt & Bender PM II telescopic sight with fixed or variable magnification. Variable telescopic sights can be used if the operator wants more flexibility to shoot at varying ranges, or when a wide field of view is required. Accuracy International actively promotes fitting the German-made Schmidt & Bender MILITARY MK II product line as sighting components on their rifles, which is rare for a rifle manufacturer. The German and Russian forces preferred a telescopic sight made by Zeiss over Accuracy International's recommendation.",

After being put on trial for execution in 1693 for practicing dark magic and betraying her coven, Agatha killed her clan and her mother through the use of her dark magic, after they attempted to execute her for her crimes. Agatha absorbed their magic in the process and took the brooch off of her mother's rotten corpse before flying off. Hundreds of years later in the modern day, Agatha resurfaced and took on the name 'Agnes' and entered the town of Westview, New Jersey to investigate the odd Pocket Reality created by Wanda Maximoff, encasing the town. Agatha then meets Wanda herself and observes her under the suspicion that Wanda may be the Scarlet Witch, a powerful mythical being referenced in the Darkhold, desiring to take her chaotic powers for herself.",

While trying to find a safe place to hide, Chris was killed, and Eric took the Ant-Man's Suit off his body. Surviving the Helicarrier crash, Eric kept the suit and operated as Ant-Man.",

Atrocitus, however, convinced Abin Sur to free him by using his knowledge of the prophecy of the Blackest Night--later manipulating Abin Sur into experiencing fear, and ultimately mortally wounding Abin Sur, directly causing the events that would lead to Hal Jordan becoming the new Green Lantern of his Sector. Later, on Ysmault, he performed a blood ritual, slaying three of the four Inversions and using their blood to create the first Red Power Battery and ring. He then christened the battery in the last Inversion's blood, thus establishing the Red Lantern Corps.",

Circumstantially, other super heroes – namely Iron Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp – also received the intercepted signal unbeknownst to Loki and arrived at the scene to reason with the green goliath. Not falling for the trick, Thor confronted Loki and exposed his scheme to the other heroes. With Loki defeated and captured, the group agreed they had worked well together and should be formalized as a team. The Wasp suggested the name Avenger, and Earth's Mightiest Heroes were born.",

The long range, durability, heavy defensive armament, and speed of the aircraft lent it it's reputation as a strategic bomber. Over 10,000 were built over the course of World War II.",

    "PageURL": "https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Bahariasaurus",
    "Summary": "Bahariasaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur from the Egyptian Bahariya formation. It was discovered by Ernest Stromer, who also discovered Spinosaurus and new remains of Carcharodontosaurus. He thought Bahariasaurus could even be the largest theropod genus known. Its remains were destroyed during World War II. Wwhile it is often thought to be related to Deltadromeus and Noasaurids, it is completely different from Ceratosaurians (incl. Noasaurs) in general and shows more Tetanuran traits (e.g. sacral pleurocoels, caudal foraminae and other traits). It also has strongly opisthocoelous and short cervicals, completely different from Noasaur ones. Despite the fact that the overlap with Deltadromeus is poor, it still shows large diferences (very different caudals, Bahariasaurus has caudals that are shorter proportionally). It is likely a Megaraptoran similar to Aoniraptor, as both have elongated vertebrae with pleurocoels only in sacrals and anterior caudals, but not in middle caudals.",

    "Summary": "The Bofors 40mm/60 Gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. Probably the best heavy MG AA weapon of World War II, Bofors guns of this type remained in service long after the war ended. This weapon was used on almost every major USA and UK warship of World War II and was a very potent AA gun. These guns are recoil operated and use a monobloc barrel with a detachable breech ring, breech casing and automatic loader. Breech block is a vertical sliding type. Although often listed as being 60 calibers long, all of these guns except for the Japanese version were actually 56.25 calibers in length. The US version was therefore named the Bofors 40mm/56.",

It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for \"arm lizard\", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means \"deep chest\". It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. Atypically, Brachiosaurus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, which resulted in a steeply inclined trunk, and a proportionally shorter tail.",

The M2 uses the much larger and much more powerful .50 BMG cartridge, which was developed alongside and takes its name from the gun itself (BMG standing for Browning Machine Gun). It has been referred to as \"Ma Deuce\", in reference to its M2 nomenclature. The design has had many specific designations; the official designation for the current infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible. It is effective against infantry, unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats, light fortifications and low-flying aircraft. The M2 machine gun has been produced longer than any other machine gun.",

Circus Baby was originally made for Afton's daughter, Elizabeth, but he forbade her from getting near Baby due to her programming.[6] Ignoring her father's warnings, Elizabeth got alone with Circus Baby, and was snatched and sealed inside of the animatronic, where she would come to die and possess Baby.[7] After Circus Baby's Pizza World closed down, Baby was trapped inside of the rental bunker until her brother, Michael Afton, came to the bunker to find her as per his father's instructions.[8] Despite seemingly still caring about her brother, Baby's isolation-induced madness lead her to fuse with the other animatronics into Ennard and scoop out Mike's innards to inhabit his body, allowing her to escape her prison.[2] The other animatronics within would come to reject her,[9] and she would rebuild herself as Scrap Baby, now intent on following in her murderous father's footsteps.[10]",

    "Summary": "The Cleveland-class light cruisers were built for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

    "Summary": "Mitchell Mayo, once an average guy went inexplicably crazy and donned the identity of the Condiment King to cause crime. He was shown tormenting multiple policemen with his special designed sauce, until he was swiftly defeated by Batgirl and Robin. He was then taken to Arkham Asylum, where he eventually was able to work in the kitchen and fuel his obsession, as well as improve upon his formula. This was further aided by Poison Ivy, who taught him vast knowledge on roots, herbs, and spices. Years later, he would get out of Arkham and be \"jokerized\". Jokerization is stated to amplify the infected's personality, which actually made Mitchell a credible threat. This would almost cause the Birds of Prey to lose to him, as they though he was a joke. It is later stated due to the nature of Condiment King's obsession/portrayal as a joke, juries and parole boards don't take him seriously, thus allowing him to be set free on Gotham again and again. During Final Crisis Aftermath, Mitchell was one of Immortus' followers, The Army of the Endangered, and was cybernetically enhanced by the brilliant Professor Achilles Milo. He was the one to introduce the \"Human Flame\" to the group, which would be a mistake. Human Flame would rebel, and along with Seductress, kill every member of The Army of the Endangered, including Mitchell.",

Quitting it soon after, Cross used his skills and resources to begin a number of highly profitable criminal operations including drug trafficking, extortion, and assassinations. Assuming the codename Crossfire, he diverted a portion of his profits to hire a small army of mercenaries to serve as his enforcers. Crossfire's goal became to foment disorder and subversion within society in order to make a profit. At one point in his career, some of his enemies booby-trapped his headquarters. The ensuing explosion robbed him of his left eye and ear, plus 85% of his hearing. He replaced his losses with cybernetic equipment. Crossfire eventually located the men who had injured him, and eliminated them personally. He has been a recurring foe of Hawkeye and Mockingbird ever since.",

Among the entelodonts, Daeodon is the largest known from a complete skeleton. Its name comes from the Greek words daios, meaning \"hostile\" or \"dreadful,\" and odon, meaning \"teeth.\"[1] The specifics of this creature's diet are uncertain, but it is most likely an opportunistic omnivore. Though some have suggested it would have more likely been a scavenger, there has been evidence in other entelodonts of predatory behavior and it had multiple characteristics that would indicate it was a predator.[2] It inhabited North America during the late Oligocene to early Miocene epochs, with many fossils found in the Agate Fossil Beds, inhabiting a seasonal floodplain environment.",

Its name means \"frightful lizard.\" Three species have been identified: Daspletosaurus torosus, Daspletosaurus horneri, and Daspletosaurus wilsoni. It lived 78–74.4 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous, on the landmass of Laramidia, an island apart of North America when the continent was split by the Western Interior Seaway. It is thought to have coexisted alongside the albertosaurine Gorgosaurus, with niche partitioning limiting competition between the two tyrannosaurids.[1]",

During a clash with the costumed crimefighter Daredevil, Ape-Man succeeded in exiling Daredevil to the void with his t-ray gun. Daredevil was able to use his powers and skills to escape through a dimensional warp, and he tracked the Exterminator and the Unholy Three to their lair. After defeating the four, Daredevil intentionally triggered the explosion of the Exterminator's main displacement machine; he had become temporarily tired of being a costumed super-hero at the time, and he was hoping to end his career as one by faking his own death with the explosion.",

It's known as a \"false saber-toothed cat\" since its teeth weren't as knife-like as other saber-toothed cats, resembling the teeth of modern domesticated cats more closely than other felines at the time.",

    "Summary": "Diprotodon is a extinct marsupial that lived in Australia during the Pleistocene era, about two million years ago. Diprotodon was a herbivorous mammal about the size of a hippo, making it the largest marsupial ever. Diprotodon became extinct sometime after 44,000 years ago, after the initial settlement of the continent; the role of human and climatic factors in its extinction are uncertain and contested. The closest surviving relatives of Diprotodon are the wombats and the koala, and so Diprotodon have sometimes been referred to as \"giant wombats\" in the popular press.",

However, Psycho-Man had secretly been brainwashing his patients instead of curing them, and his treatment failed to affect Wade, only making his insanity worse. This caused him to go on a universal (eventually multiversal) genocide spree as Dreadpool.",

It is said a single Balor may own thousands, or even millions of dretches. Every pitiful soul that ends up in hell, every chaotic evil death that doesn't have some divine purpose, becomes a dretch or merely withers away. Thus the armies of the damned are fueled. The only escape is to attain a better form, a difficult process that often takes centuries. Few dretches survive for that long.",

It was named for the place that the first specimen identified as this genus: Edmonton, the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. It was widespread across North America, and several specimens previously identified as different genera have been attributed to Edmontosaurus. This creature favored coastal plains and coasts, and its widespread distribution indicates that they would migrate and lived in herds. E. annectens differed from E. regalis in that it lacked a comb-like crest adorning its head.",

    "Summary": "The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.",

After the events of Season 3, he was kidnapped by the Soviets and forced to do manual labor for them as their prisoner.

Hence, Voorhees induced one of the cobras kept in the laboratory to bite both Shecktor and himself. Voorhees planned to use the universal antitoxin to save himself from death. Unknown to Voorhees, the cobra had been irradiated. The combination of the radioactive venom in his bloodstream and the experimental anti-toxin which he used created a mutagenic catalyst which gave Voorhees certain cobra-like powers.",

It is thought the males used their horns for jousting in intraspecific combat. The adults would have likely inhabited open woodlands and savannas during its time.[2]",

Based on background signage seen throughout the New 52 books (including Justice League), LexCorp also exists. In Justice League No. 2, Batman notes that he and Superman have at least one thing in common: both of them speak openly of their distaste for Luthor. In the New 52 Action Comics (a series set some time before the events of Justice League #1), Luthor is hired by General Sam Lane to capture Superman by setting a train accident as a trap for him. The younger Superman, who is weaker and inexperienced, barely stops the train and is left unconscious. Lex collects Superman and subjects him to a series of tests to ascertain his strengths and weaknesses. He tortures Superman until the latter manages to escape. Lex is later revealed to have obtained contact with the \"Collector of Worlds\" through unknown means and was told to say the word \"Krypton\" to Superman. He later appears when the Collector abducts New Troy as one of the residents in the area. He along with Lois and Jimmy go into Glen Glenmorgan's hotel where Lex calls the Collector and it is revealed that Lex had made a deal with him. It is later revealed that Lex Luthor was the secret caller named \"Icarus\" that was giving secret information on Glen Glenmorgan to Clark Kent.",

Among its most outstanding traits was its size; it was not only the largest dicynodont, but also the largest non-mammalian synapsid to have lived, rivalling the size of modern African Elephants.[1] In the place Lisowycia was discovered, there were no plateosaurid sauropodomorphs, which may explain why it could have reached comparable sizes; it could also have been also to support a larger gut for metabolic demands, among other possible causes.[2][3] Another trait that set it apart from other dicynodonts was that it had an erect gait, as opposed to a sprawling gait.[1] It inhabited a swampy wetland environment that was present in Poland during its time, and was the only large herbivore in its habitat.[3]",

    "Summary": "The 20mm/99 M61 Vulcan hydraulically/pneumatically-driven, electrically-fired, air-cooled, 20mm six-barrelled rotary cannon fires at an extremely high rate of between 4000 to 6000 rounds per minute. The Vulcan has been the main cannon armament of United States military combat aircraft for over fifty years. The several aircraft at the time were originally designed without an internal cannon, as it was believed that missiles had made guns obsolete; however, air-to-air combat experience in Vietnam showed that a gun could still be more effective than guided missiles in many combat situations, and that an externally carried gun pod was less effective than an internal gun, so the M61A1 Vulcan became standard as of the F-4E Phantom II. The initial M61 used linked, belted ammunition, but the ejection of spent links created considerable problems, and was soon replaced by the improved M61A1 with a linkless feed system. A lighter version of the Vulcan, the M61A2, was developed for use on the F-22 Raptor, which is mechanically the same as the M61A1 but with thinner barrels to reduce overall weight to 93 kilograms (202 pounds), allowing it to reach a slightly higher maximum rate of fire at 6600 rounds per minute. In addition to being mounted on the majority of combat aircraft, there also exist two land-based applications: the M163 Vulcan Air Defense System self-propelled anti-aircraft gun and the M167 Vulcan Air Defense System towed anti-aircraft gun.",

The M67 hand grenade has an effective casualty radius of about 15 meters. It is considered a \"defensive fragmentation grenade\" because it must be used from the safety of cover, since the range of its fragments is greater than a human can throw the grenade.",

This state of affairs lasted only briefly before the adventurers ultimately slew the dragon, killing all of Meepo's tribe as a consequence: only Meepo escaped.",

It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190.

When Heather was still a girl, her father was driving her and her mother through the desert when they accidentally happened to see the spaceship of Thanos land; the space villain didn't want any witnesses, so he blew their car up. Heather was thrown clear off and survived, but her parents were killed. She was found by Thanos' father, Mentor, who took her to his homeworld, Titan, to be raised by the Titanian Shao-Lorn monks in their monastery. While there, Heather studied the Titans' ways and disciplines to unlock her latent psychic potential and gained her mental and physical powers. Dedicating her power to hunting down Thanos, who had returned and razed Titan, she came upon the Avengers and joined their ranks.",

    "Summary": "The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is an African crocodile, the largest freshwater predator in Africa, and may be considered the second-largest extant reptile and crocodilian in the world, after the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). The Nile crocodile is quite widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, occurring mostly in the central, eastern, and southern regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and marshlands. Although capable of living in saline environments, this species is rarely found in saltwater, but occasionally inhabits deltas and brackish lakes. The range of this species once stretched northward throughout the Nile, as far north as the Nile delta. On average, the adult male Nile crocodile is between 3.5 and 5 m (11.5 and 16.4 ft) in length and weighs 225 to 750 kg (500 to 1,650 lb). However, specimens exceeding 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and weighing up to 1,090 kg (2,400 lb) have been recorded. Sexual dimorphism is prevalent, and females are usually about 30% smaller than males. They have thick, scaly, heavily armored skin.",

Some so similar to each other you could spend a lifetime searching for any distinction, others so radically different they defy comprehension. [...] Every version of reality balances precariously on this singular Earth. It seems so different from the Earths we know. I can't imagine what series of decisions led to this world hurtling out of its orbit. But I know this, the source of the cataclysm was the same as it always is - man. [...] You know better.

    "Summary": "Perucetus Colossus is a prehistoric cetacean that lived 39 to 37 million years ago. Discovered in August 2023 by a team of Peruvian paleontologists, mainly from the National University of San Marcos, Perucetus Colossus is believed to have potentially been the largest animal ever in terms of mass, with an estimated length of 17 to 20.1 meters and an estimated weight of 60 to 70 tonnes.[1] The original, inaccurate estimate was much higher (85 to 340 tonnes). It is known from thirteen vertebrae, four ribs, and some parts of the pelvic region.",

A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures,[6] for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals,[6][7][8] which make up most of its diet.[3] Although most polar bears are born on land,[9] they spend most of their time on the sea ice.[10] Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\" and derives from this fact.[2] Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice,[3] often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.[2]",

Left an orphan on the streets of early Nazi Germany, Johann turned to a life of theft until he began working as a bellhop in his late teens. During this time he ended up rescuing Germany's then-leader Adolf Hitler from an assassination attempt, who was so impressed with the hatred of mankind he could see within Schmidt that he began to personally train him into a \"perfect soldier\".

    "Summary": "The Rheinmetall 120mm gun is a smoothbore tank gun designed and produced by the West German Rheinmetall-DeTec AG company, developed in response to Soviet advances in armor technology and development of new armored threats. Production began in 1974, with the first version of the gun, known as the L/44 as it was 44 calibers long, used on the German Leopard 2 tank and soon produced under license for the American M1A1 Abrams and other tanks. The 120-millimeter gun has a length of 5.28 meters, and the gun system weighs approximately 3,317 kilograms. A variety of ammunition has been developed for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warhead warheads. Recent ammunition includes a wide range of new anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions, giving tanks armed with the L/44 and its derivatives greater versatility on the modern battlefield. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armor and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.",

When the alien entity called the Master of the Sun visited the space station that Quill was stationed at and offered the mantle of Star-Lord to a worthy candidate, Quill volunteered, but was rejected in favour of another astronaut. Quill was outraged, stole a scoutship, and on returning to the space station took his colleague's place. Quill was then chosen to become Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which he was able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called \"Ship\", Quill commenced his role as Star-Lord.",

Dixon spent years planning advertising campaigns for children's toys and other products, but believed that through his marketing abilities he was making fortunes for his clients, while he himself labored in relative obscurity for far less financial gain. Moreover, Dixon believed that through his advertising projects he was perpetrating lies on behalf of his clients and subverting the nation's moral values. Dixon even took a perverse pleasure in such activities. He prided himself on selling products he regarded as worthless so successfully to the public, and he regarded the American public with contempt, believing them willing to believe any lie spread through the mass media, if it was crafted convincingly enough.",

It normally would be classified as a \"destructive device\" due to the rifle's groove diameter of .950 inches. However SSK was given a \"Sporting Use Exception\" in order to deregulate the rifle. Due to its heavy weight and massive recoil, it can only be shot from a bench rest or heavy bipod, which even then runs risk of injury. As such, the gun is more of a novelty than any combat or sporting weapon.",

It has proved popular as a civilian, police, and military rifle since its introduction in the 1980s. The rifles have some features that improve performance in very cold conditions (which gave the rifle its name), without impairing operation in less extreme conditions. Arctic Warfare rifles are generally fitted with a Schmidt & Bender PM II telescopic sight with fixed or variable magnification. Variable telescopic sights can be used if the operator wants more flexibility to shoot at varying ranges, or when a wide field of view is required. Accuracy International actively promotes fitting the German-made Schmidt & Bender MILITARY MK II product line as sighting components on their rifles, which is rare for a rifle manufacturer. The German and Russian forces preferred a telescopic sight made by Zeiss over Accuracy International's recommendation.",

    "Summary": "Amelia Voght discovered her powers of transubtantiating matter into vapour at a young age and was ostracized by her parents, like many other mutants. Choosing to embark on a journey far from the judgmental eyes of her past, she pursued a career in nursing and eventually found herself in India. Here, she met Charles Xavier, a fellow American who had lost the use of his legs. Amelia cared for Charles after his injury, and her positive and friendly attitude helped Xavier get over his depression. The two quickly fell in love, and shared an apartment in Mumbai. Eventually discovering that Xavier was a mutant himself, this link strengthened their relationship even more, but over time they both developed different stances on human-mutant interaction. Xavier wanted open co-existence with humans, while Amelia thought it was best for mutants to hide themselves. When Xavier brought Scott Summers to his mansion for training, Amelia left him, telling him that his plans for the X-Men would only lead to a genetic arms race and ultimately doom mutantkind.",

It is most commonly made of wood, but can also be crafted from bone, stone, or modern materials like plastic. The most famous type is the returning boomerang, which is carefully shaped and balanced so that when thrown with the correct spin, it travels in a curved path and comes back to the thrower. However, not all boomerangs were designed to return—many were larger, heavier hunting boomerangs used to strike animals, and these would fly straight rather than circle back.",

Fossils of Carcinosoma are restricted to deposits of late Silurian (Late Llandovery to Early Pridoli) age. Classified as part of the family Carcinosomatidae, which the genus lends its name to, Carcinosoma contains seven species from North America and Great Britain. Carcinosomatid eurypterids had unusual proportions and features compared to other eurypterids, with a broad abdomen, thin and long tail and spined and forward-facing walking appendages. They were not as streamlined as other groups but had considerably more robust and well developed walking appendages. In Carcinosoma, these spined walking appendages are thought to have been used to create a trap to capture prey in. The telson (final segment of the body) of Carcinosoma appears to have possessed distinct segmentation, Carcinosoma is the only known eurypterid to possess this feature.",

He was shown tormenting multiple policemen with his special designed sauce, until he was swiftly defeated by Batgirl and Robin. He was then taken to Arkham Asylum, where he eventually was able to work in the kitchen and fuel his obsession, as well as improve upon his formula. This was further aided by Poison Ivy, who taught him vast knowledge on roots, herbs, and spices. Years later, he would get out of Arkham and be \"jokerized\". Jokerization is stated to amplify the infected's personality, which actually made Mitchell a credible threat. This would almost cause the Birds of Prey to lose to him, as they though he was a joke. It is later stated due to the nature of Condiment King's obsession/portrayal as a joke, juries and parole boards don't take him seriously, thus allowing him to be set free on Gotham again and again. During Final Crisis Aftermath, Mitchell was one of Immortus' followers, The Army of the Endangered, and was cybernetically enhanced by the brilliant Professor Achilles Milo. He was the one to introduce the \"Human Flame\" to the group, which would be a mistake. Human Flame would rebel, and along with Seductress, kill every member of The Army of the Endangered, including Mitchell.",

    "Summary": "Gastornis is a genus of large, flightless bird, considered to be related to modern fowl. It was initially thought to be carnivorous, but more recent evidence (such as the tips its beak and claws lacking a hook-like shape, and analysis of calcium isotopes in its bones[1]) indicates that it was herbivorous,[2] its large beak suited to breaking seeds and other tough plant matter rather than catching small mammals. It lived during the mid Paleocene to mid Eocene epochs, throughout North America, Europe, and Asia, inhabiting lush environments that existed even in the Arctic during its time.",

    "Summary": "The Heckler & Koch HK416 is a rifle designed and manufactured by Heckler & Koch. Although its design is in large part based on the AR-15 class of weapons, specifically the Colt M4 carbine family issued to the U.S. military, it uses an HK-proprietary short-stroke gas piston system originally derived from the ArmaLite AR-18 (the same system was also used in Heckler & Koch's earlier G36 family of rifles). It is the standard assault rifle of the Norwegian Armed Forces, and was the weapon used by SEAL Team Six to kill Osama Bin Laden in 2011. It has also been selected as replacement of the FAMAS in the French Armed Forces. Since 2013, a new updated version called the HK416 A3 has effectively replaced the original HK416, with the A5 featuring several improvements like an improved tool-less adjustable gas regulator for suppressor use that can accommodate barrel lengths down to 10.5 inches without modifications, a redesigned lower receiver with ambidextrous fire controls, optimised magazine and ammunition compatibility, a repair kit housed inside the pistol grip, and additional heavy nuts to make its weak spots more resistant to accidental impact. The A7 version is basically a German-exclusive selector update on the A5, where the selector now rotates 90 degrees instead of the typical 180 degrees on most M16 rifles and their variants. The A8 version of the rifle, dubbed the G95KA1, was selected as the successor to the G36 as the new standard issue rifle for the German Bundeswehr in 2022.",

    "Summary": "The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.",

He has also been addressed as \"Sheriff Hopper,\" but this is not a correct title. Hopper was married and they had a daughter together, Sarah. They divorced after his young daughter died of cancer, which caused him to lapse into alcoholism. For a few years after Sarah's death, he was a cop in \"a big city\"; the show never states which city. When he had been in the city long enough, he moved back to Hawkins. Eventually, he grows to be more responsible, saving Will Byers as well as taking Eleven in as his adopted daughter. In Season 3, he tries to break up Eleven and Mike since their relationship is moving too fast for him, whilst simultaneously trying to rekindle his relationship with Joyce. After the events of Season 3, he was kidnapped by the Soviets and forced to do manual labor for them as their prisoner. He eventually managed to escape, and returned to his life with Eleven and Joyce.",

    "Summary": "The kukri, also known as the khukuri (Nepali: खुकुरी khukuri) is a knife, originating from the Indian subcontinent, associated with the Nepali speaking Gurkhas of Nepal. The knife has an inwardly curved blade, similar to a machete, used as both a tool and as a weapon in Nepal and India. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the Gurkha. It is a characteristic weapon of the Nepalese Army, the Royal Gurkha Rifles of the British Army, the Assam Rifles, the Assam Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, the Gorkha regiments of the Indian Army, and of all Gurkha regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The khukuri often appears in Nepalese and Indian Gorkha heraldry and is used in many traditional rituals such as wedding ceremonies. The kukri, khukri, and kukkri spellings are of Indian origin, the original Nepali form being khukuri.",

It was originally a contender for a 5.56 mm Australian military service rifle to replace the then-issued Lithgow L1A1 SLR and Colt M16A1 rifles. What was unique about this endeavor was that Australia had never designed or manufactured its own commercial gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. The rifle was abandoned when the Steyr AUG was adopted for use by the Australian military.",

It is by far one of the most widespread rifles as well, with over 37 million units having been made since its inception in 1891, and despite its age, it still sees intense conflict in the modern age. It primarily makes use of the 7.62x54mm cartridge, though it is also compatible with the following cartridges: 7.62×53mmR (Finnish variants only), 7.92×57mm Mauser (Polish variants and German captures) and 8×50mmR Mannlicher (Austrian captures).",

The Nile crocodile is quite widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, occurring mostly in the central, eastern, and southern regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and marshlands. Although capable of living in saline environments, this species is rarely found in saltwater, but occasionally inhabits deltas and brackish lakes. The range of this species once stretched northward throughout the Nile, as far north as the Nile delta. On average, the adult male Nile crocodile is between 3.5 and 5 m (11.5 and 16.4 ft) in length and weighs 225 to 750 kg (500 to 1,650 lb). However, specimens exceeding 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and weighing up to 1,090 kg (2,400 lb) have been recorded. Sexual dimorphism is prevalent, and females are usually about 30% smaller than males. They have thick, scaly, heavily armored skin.",

    "Summary": "Odobenocetops is a genus tooth whale, belonging to the same group as dolphins or porpoises. Despite this, it bares many similarities to walruses, notably in its distinctive asymmetrical tusks; the type species O. peruvianus had tusk lengths of 45–55 cm and 20 cm for its right and left respectively,[1] while O. leptodon had a left tusk at a longer 25 cm and a right tusk at 1.35 meters[2] The function of these tusks is unknown, but due to their brittle nature, they would have not been used for jousting, and rather they likely served other intraspecific purposes. Along with walruses, they also display convergent evolution with narwhals, with their skulls being entirely toothless aside from these tusks.",

Unlike carnivorans, it had stiffened vertebrae similar to armadillos or pangolins, thought to be a tradeoff of flexibility for larger size.[1] In life, they would have been terrestrial apex predators adapted for hunting on the forest floor.[2]",

A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures,[6] for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals,[6][7][8] which make up most of its diet.[3] Although most polar bears are born on land,[9] they spend most of their time on the sea ice.[10] Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\" and derives from this fact.[2] Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice,[3] often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.[2]",

Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas.",

    "Summary": "Sawn-Off Shotgun A sawed-off shotgun (US, CAN) also called a sawn-off shotgun (UK, IRL, AU, NZ) and a short-barreled shotgun (SBS) (U.S. legislative terminology), is a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel—typically under 18 inches—and often a shortened or absent stock. Despite the colloquial term, barrels do not, strictly speaking, have to be shortened with a saw. Barrels can be manufactured at shorter lengths as an alternative to traditional, longer barrels. This makes them easier to transport due to their smaller profile and lighter weight. The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces, a feature sought by military close quarters combat units, law enforcement SWAT team users, and home defense purposes. As a result of the shorter barrel length, any sawed-off shotgun with a magazine tube will have its capacity reduced.",

These creatures first emerged around 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago, during the early Pleistocene.[1] Around 3,200 years ago, the Thylacine population on mainland Australia would have died off, the major causes thought to be human activity and the introduction of dingoes.[2] Populations would remain prevalent on the island of Tasmania up until the early 20th century, before extermination by farmers and bounty hunters, along with habitat loss, competition from wild dogs, and disease would devastate them (with possibly already low genetic diversity worsening their chances of survival).[3] The last Thylacine was captured and kept in Hobart Zoo until he died on September 7, 1936.",

    "Summary": "The 16\"/50 (40.6 cm) caliber gun Mark 7 was the main armament of the Iowa-class battleships. This was possibly the best battleship gun ever put into service. Originally intended to fire the relatively light 2240 pound (1016 kg) AP Mark 5 projectile, the shell handling system for these guns was redesigned to use the \"super-heavy\" 2700 pound (1224.7 kg) AP Mark 8 before any of the USS Iowa class (BB-61) battleships were laid down.",

    "Summary": "The 3″/50 (7.62 cm) caliber gun Mark 22 was a US naval gun of a simpler construction than the previous class of 3\" guns, and successive versions were improved designs. This gun was widely used up to the 1930s, but were then gradually replaced on larger ships by 5\"/25 (12.7 cm) single mountings and later by Bofors 40mm guns in twin and quad mountings. During World War II, this weapon was extensively used on smaller warships such as destroyer escorts, submarines and auxiliaries along with many merchant ships, with about 14,000 guns being produced between 1940 and 1945.",

    "Summary": "The 6\"/47 (15.2 cm) caliber gun Mark 16 was a feature of many US Navy light cruisers during World War II. These guns were used to arm the Brooklyn- and Cleveland-class light cruisers, the latter being the most numerous class of cruisers ever built. The 6\"/47 caliber gun was one of several weapons developed by the United States Navy in the 1930s to fire \"super-heavy\" armor-piercing projectiles, thus increasing warships' destructive power while complying with the limits on bore diameter set by the London Naval Treaty. Compared with the previous 6\"/53 caliber guns, the 6\"/47 Mark 16 fired a 59 kilogram (130 pounds) projectile instead of a 48 kilogram (105 pounds) projectile. These new projectiles had almost double the penetration performance when compared against the older 6\"/53 (15.2 cm) AP projectiles used for the Omaha class (CL-4) light cruisers.",

The rifles have some features that improve performance in very cold conditions (which gave the rifle its name), without impairing operation in less extreme conditions. Arctic Warfare rifles are generally fitted with a Schmidt & Bender PM II telescopic sight with fixed or variable magnification. Variable telescopic sights can be used if the operator wants more flexibility to shoot at varying ranges, or when a wide field of view is required. Accuracy International actively promotes fitting the German-made Schmidt & Bender MILITARY MK II product line as sighting components on their rifles, which is rare for a rifle manufacturer. The German and Russian forces preferred a telescopic sight made by Zeiss over Accuracy International's recommendation.",

Agatha absorbed their magic in the process and took the brooch off of her mother's rotten corpse before flying off. Hundreds of years later in the modern day, Agatha resurfaced and took on the name 'Agnes' and entered the town of Westview, New Jersey to investigate the odd Pocket Reality created by Wanda Maximoff, encasing the town. Agatha then meets Wanda herself and observes her under the suspicion that Wanda may be the Scarlet Witch, a powerful mythical being referenced in the Darkhold, desiring to take her chaotic powers for herself.",

The original design was the basis of several later weapons, including the original USAS-12 combat shotgun. It is available for commercial purchase only in full automatic mode, however, it fires at a rate of 300 rounds per minute, allowing it to fire one round at a time with brief trigger pulls.

Atrocitus, however, convinced Abin Sur to free him by using his knowledge of the prophecy of the Blackest Night--later manipulating Abin Sur into experiencing fear, and ultimately mortally wounding Abin Sur, directly causing the events that would lead to Hal Jordan becoming the new Green Lantern of his Sector. Later, on Ysmault, he performed a blood ritual, slaying three of the four Inversions and using their blood to create the first Red Power Battery and ring. He then christened the battery in the last Inversion's blood, thus establishing the Red Lantern Corps.",

Bacteria resemble tall, thin, black humanoids that appear to be made of wires. Bacteria first was shown in The Backrooms: Found Footage, the first episode of the series, in which one chases and presumably kills Kane Pints. It exhibits similar behavior in the episodes Found Footage #2 and Pitfalls and is seen climbing on the ceiling in The Backrooms- Motion Detected. In Autopsy Report, more is learned about the nature of Bacteria, with it being implied to be a mutated strain of the hay bacillus disease. Despite all this, much about Bacteria is still left to be seen.",

    "PageURL": "https://vsbattles.fandom.com/wiki/Bahariasaurus",
    "Summary": "Bahariasaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur from the Egyptian Bahariya formation. It was discovered by Ernest Stromer, who also discovered Spinosaurus and new remains of Carcharodontosaurus. He thought Bahariasaurus could even be the largest theropod genus known. Its remains were destroyed during World War II. Wwhile it is often thought to be related to Deltadromeus and Noasaurids, it is completely different from Ceratosaurians (incl. Noasaurs) in general and shows more Tetanuran traits (e.g. sacral pleurocoels, caudal foraminae and other traits). It also has strongly opisthocoelous and short cervicals, completely different from Noasaur ones. Despite the fact that the overlap with Deltadromeus is poor, it still shows large diferences (very different caudals, Bahariasaurus has caudals that are shorter proportionally). It is likely a Megaraptoran similar to Aoniraptor, as both have elongated vertebrae with pleurocoels only in sacrals and anterior caudals, but not in middle caudals.",

Additionally, their 8\"/55 (203mm) main guns and secondary 5\"/38 (127mm) guns were regularly used to bombard land targets in support of amphibious landings. After the war, only six Baltimores and two Oregon City-class ships remained in service, while the rest were moved to the reserve fleet.",

It was there that the sadistic prisoners made fifteen thousand children watch as their parents were gunned down over a period of days.

    "Summary": "The Bofors 40mm/60 Gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. Probably the best heavy MG AA weapon of World War II, Bofors guns of this type remained in service long after the war ended. This weapon was used on almost every major USA and UK warship of World War II and was a very potent AA gun. These guns are recoil operated and use a monobloc barrel with a detachable breech ring, breech casing and automatic loader. Breech block is a vertical sliding type. Although often listed as being 60 calibers long, all of these guns except for the Japanese version were actually 56.25 calibers in length. The US version was therefore named the Bofors 40mm/56.",

However, not all boomerangs were designed to return—many were larger, heavier hunting boomerangs used to strike animals, and these would fly straight rather than circle back.",

It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for \"arm lizard\", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means \"deep chest\". It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. Atypically, Brachiosaurus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, which resulted in a steeply inclined trunk, and a proportionally shorter tail.",

Its design is similar to Browning's earlier M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the .30-06 cartridge. The M2 uses the much larger and much more powerful .50 BMG cartridge, which was developed alongside and takes its name from the gun itself (BMG standing for Browning Machine Gun). It has been referred to as \"Ma Deuce\", in reference to its M2 nomenclature. The design has had many specific designations; the official designation for the current infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible. It is effective against infantry, unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats, light fortifications and low-flying aircraft. The M2 machine gun has been produced longer than any other machine gun.",

During the Kree's war with the Skrulls, Danvers returned to Earth and began recalling her past, with help from Nick Fury and Maria Rambeau.

Fossils of Carcinosoma are restricted to deposits of late Silurian (Late Llandovery to Early Pridoli) age. Classified as part of the family Carcinosomatidae, which the genus lends its name to, Carcinosoma contains seven species from North America and Great Britain. Carcinosomatid eurypterids had unusual proportions and features compared to other eurypterids, with a broad abdomen, thin and long tail and spined and forward-facing walking appendages. They were not as streamlined as other groups but had considerably more robust and well developed walking appendages. In Carcinosoma, these spined walking appendages are thought to have been used to create a trap to capture prey in. The telson (final segment of the body) of Carcinosoma appears to have possessed distinct segmentation, Carcinosoma is the only known eurypterid to possess this feature.",

Circus Baby was originally made for Afton's daughter, Elizabeth, but he forbade her from getting near Baby due to her programming.[6] Ignoring her father's warnings, Elizabeth got alone with Circus Baby, and was snatched and sealed inside of the animatronic, where she would come to die and possess Baby.[7] After Circus Baby's Pizza World closed down, Baby was trapped inside of the rental bunker until her brother, Michael Afton, came to the bunker to find her as per his father's instructions.[8] Despite seemingly still caring about her brother, Baby's isolation-induced madness lead her to fuse with the other animatronics into Ennard and scoop out Mike's innards to inhabit his body, allowing her to escape her prison.[2] The other animatronics within would come to reject her,[9] and she would rebuild herself as Scrap Baby, now intent on following in her murderous father's footsteps.[10]",

    "Summary": "The Cleveland-class light cruisers were built for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

He was shown tormenting multiple policemen with his special designed sauce, until he was swiftly defeated by Batgirl and Robin. He was then taken to Arkham Asylum, where he eventually was able to work in the kitchen and fuel his obsession, as well as improve upon his formula. This was further aided by Poison Ivy, who taught him vast knowledge on roots, herbs, and spices. Years later, he would get out of Arkham and be \"jokerized\". Jokerization is stated to amplify the infected's personality, which actually made Mitchell a credible threat. This would almost cause the Birds of Prey to lose to him, as they though he was a joke. It is later stated due to the nature of Condiment King's obsession/portrayal as a joke, juries and parole boards don't take him seriously, thus allowing him to be set free on Gotham again and again. During Final Crisis Aftermath, Mitchell was one of Immortus' followers, The Army of the Endangered, and was cybernetically enhanced by the brilliant Professor Achilles Milo. He was the one to introduce the \"Human Flame\" to the group, which would be a mistake. Human Flame would rebel, and along with Seductress, kill every member of The Army of the Endangered, including Mitchell.",

It lived around 251–242 million years ago, during the early to middle Triassic in oceans around present-day North America and Europe. The largest of this genus were not only one of the largest ichthyosaurs, but also among the largest animals of its time.",

It lived in present day Europe around 154-140 million years ago, spanning the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous. By length and mass, Dacentrurus is among the largest (if not the largest) stegosaurid dinosaur, on average exceeding the size of both species of the more iconic Stegosaurus.",

    "Summary": "Daeodon is a genus of entelodont, a group informally referred to as \"Hell Pigs\" or \"Terminator Pigs\"; however, entelodonts are thought to be more closely related to hippos and cetaceans than pigs, hogs, or peccaries. Among the entelodonts, Daeodon is the largest known from a complete skeleton. Its name comes from the Greek words daios, meaning \"hostile\" or \"dreadful,\" and odon, meaning \"teeth.\"[1] The specifics of this creature's diet are uncertain, but it is most likely an opportunistic omnivore. Though some have suggested it would have more likely been a scavenger, there has been evidence in other entelodonts of predatory behavior and it had multiple characteristics that would indicate it was a predator.[2] It inhabited North America during the late Oligocene to early Miocene epochs, with many fossils found in the Agate Fossil Beds, inhabiting a seasonal floodplain environment.",

In this role, Sterling was the costumed mastermind behind a series of crimes committed by the original criminal team known as the Unholy Three (Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man). During a clash with the costumed crimefighter Daredevil, Ape-Man succeeded in exiling Daredevil to the void with his t-ray gun. Daredevil was able to use his powers and skills to escape through a dimensional warp, and he tracked the Exterminator and the Unholy Three to their lair. After defeating the four, Daredevil intentionally triggered the explosion of the Exterminator's main displacement machine; he had become temporarily tired of being a costumed super-hero at the time, and he was hoping to end his career as one by faking his own death with the explosion.",

It is most widely thought to be a herbivore, with its blunt teeth and shovel-like snout helping it to dig up vegetation to eat.[1][2] It was widely spread across Pangaea during the late Triassic around 228–210 million years ago, found in the Dockum formation, Chinle formation, and Post quarry; the density of numbers in specific areas also hints it was likely a herd animal.[2]",

Diprotodon was a herbivorous mammal about the size of a hippo, making it the largest marsupial ever. Diprotodon became extinct sometime after 44,000 years ago, after the initial settlement of the continent; the role of human and climatic factors in its extinction are uncertain and contested. The closest surviving relatives of Diprotodon are the wombats and the koala, and so Diprotodon have sometimes been referred to as \"giant wombats\" in the popular press.",

The size of Edmontosaurus makes it among the largest hadrosaurs. It was named for the place that the first specimen identified as this genus: Edmonton, the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. It was widespread across North America, and several specimens previously identified as different genera have been attributed to Edmontosaurus. This creature favored coastal plains and coasts, and its widespread distribution indicates that they would migrate and lived in herds. E. annectens differed from E. regalis in that it lacked a comb-like crest adorning its head.",

His savagery while serving in the US black-ops earned him the nickname Erik Killmonger.

Manipulating and then killing Ulysses Klaue to gain access to their city, Killmonger seemingly killed T'Challa during ritual combat and took the throne, but just before Killmonger unleashed his plan, the Black Panther had returned and challenged Killmonger, eventually killing him in their final battle.",

    "Summary": "A longsword is a type of European sword characterized as having a cruciform hilt with a grip for two-handed use (around 16 to 28 cm (6 to 11 in)) and a straight double-edged blade of around 85 to 110 cm (33 to 43 in). It was prevalent during the late medieval and Renaissance periods (approximately 1350 to 1550), with early and late use reaching into the 13th and 17th centuries, and can owe it's success to its versatile cross-guard, and it's flexible, straight blade, which is effective at stabbing and resisting damage.",

The World’s scientists heated up time itself until it flowed in all directions at once. Into this pliant, fast-moving substance, they introduced human test groups, whose genetic material was crudely spliced with adaptive Nano-Sentinel technology, and ran the result through half a million years of cyborg mutation in eighteen months. Charlie’s nervous system was extracted and mutated into the autonomous entity named E.V.A.",

While generally solitary, a rare few grell form great colonies led by philosophers, grell wizards that study the aberrant sciences of their native realm.

Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

Immediately, the god fled, but the youth was struck by his presence, and came to despair when she failed to find him. Another god came to her aid, and taught her the song of the birds in an attempt to lure the other deity back. After failing, the elf maiden cursed the gods, and became the first Harpy.",

    "Summary": "The Heckler & Koch HK416 is a rifle designed and manufactured by Heckler & Koch. Although its design is in large part based on the AR-15 class of weapons, specifically the Colt M4 carbine family issued to the U.S. military, it uses an HK-proprietary short-stroke gas piston system originally derived from the ArmaLite AR-18 (the same system was also used in Heckler & Koch's earlier G36 family of rifles). It is the standard assault rifle of the Norwegian Armed Forces, and was the weapon used by SEAL Team Six to kill Osama Bin Laden in 2011. It has also been selected as replacement of the FAMAS in the French Armed Forces. Since 2013, a new updated version called the HK416 A3 has effectively replaced the original HK416, with the A5 featuring several improvements like an improved tool-less adjustable gas regulator for suppressor use that can accommodate barrel lengths down to 10.5 inches without modifications, a redesigned lower receiver with ambidextrous fire controls, optimised magazine and ammunition compatibility, a repair kit housed inside the pistol grip, and additional heavy nuts to make its weak spots more resistant to accidental impact. The A7 version is basically a German-exclusive selector update on the A5, where the selector now rotates 90 degrees instead of the typical 180 degrees on most M16 rifles and their variants. The A8 version of the rifle, dubbed the G95KA1, was selected as the successor to the G36 as the new standard issue rifle for the German Bundeswehr in 2022.",

    "Summary": "The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.",

Joining the U.S. Marine Corps by adulthood, he became close friends with Francis \"Frank\" Castle, but they were both recruited into Operation Cerberus, a secret illegal military drug trafficking scheme in Afghanistan which resulted in the murder of an Afghan police officer and the deaths of numerous soldiers, ostensibly to help win the war. After returning home, Billy (who now owned a private military firm) was hired by the operation's ringleader to cover up the campaign by killing all involved personnel still alive, including Frank (now known as \"the Punisher\"), but the conspiracy was ultimately foiled and Russo's face was violently mutilated during a fight with his former friend, before being arrested.",

Several criminals were killed, and Russo was thrown through a glass pane head-first. Somehow, he survived with his face torn to shreds; surgeons stitched it back together like a jigsaw puzzle. Taking advantage of his now hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster took on the identity of Jigsaw and swore revenge against the vigilante, becoming his archnemesis.",

They divorced after his young daughter died of cancer, which caused him to lapse into alcoholism. For a few years after Sarah's death, he was a cop in \"a big city\"; the show never states which city. When he had been in the city long enough, he moved back to Hawkins. Eventually, he grows to be more responsible, saving Will Byers as well as taking Eleven in as his adopted daughter. In Season 3, he tries to break up Eleven and Mike since their relationship is moving too fast for him, whilst simultaneously trying to rekindle his relationship with Joyce. After the events of Season 3, he was kidnapped by the Soviets and forced to do manual labor for them as their prisoner. He eventually managed to escape, and returned to his life with Eleven and Joyce.",

    "Summary": "Kubanochoerus is an extinct genus of large, long-legged suid. It lived in Africa, Europe, and Asia during the Miocene epoch, about 15.9 to 7.3 million years ago. The largest species, Kubanochoerus gigas, could reach notable sizes, standing about 1 meter at the shoulder and attaining masses of 500 kg.[1] Its most distinctive feature is the presence of horns on their skulls, with two small brow horns, and males possessing long horns on the top of their heads often likened to unicorn horns. It is thought the males used their horns for jousting in intraspecific combat. The adults would have likely inhabited open woodlands and savannas during its time.[2]",

    "Summary": "The kukri, also known as the khukuri (Nepali: खुकुरी khukuri) is a knife, originating from the Indian subcontinent, associated with the Nepali speaking Gurkhas of Nepal. The knife has an inwardly curved blade, similar to a machete, used as both a tool and as a weapon in Nepal and India. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the Gurkha. It is a characteristic weapon of the Nepalese Army, the Royal Gurkha Rifles of the British Army, the Assam Rifles, the Assam Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, the Gorkha regiments of the Indian Army, and of all Gurkha regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The khukuri often appears in Nepalese and Indian Gorkha heraldry and is used in many traditional rituals such as wedding ceremonies. The kukri, khukri, and kukkri spellings are of Indian origin, the original Nepali form being khukuri.",

Based on background signage seen throughout the New 52 books (including Justice League), LexCorp also exists. In Justice League No. 2, Batman notes that he and Superman have at least one thing in common: both of them speak openly of their distaste for Luthor. In the New 52 Action Comics (a series set some time before the events of Justice League #1), Luthor is hired by General Sam Lane to capture Superman by setting a train accident as a trap for him. The younger Superman, who is weaker and inexperienced, barely stops the train and is left unconscious. Lex collects Superman and subjects him to a series of tests to ascertain his strengths and weaknesses. He tortures Superman until the latter manages to escape. Lex is later revealed to have obtained contact with the \"Collector of Worlds\" through unknown means and was told to say the word \"Krypton\" to Superman. He later appears when the Collector abducts New Troy as one of the residents in the area. He along with Lois and Jimmy go into Glen Glenmorgan's hotel where Lex calls the Collector and it is revealed that Lex had made a deal with him. It is later revealed that Lex Luthor was the secret caller named \"Icarus\" that was giving secret information on Glen Glenmorgan to Clark Kent.",

Among its most outstanding traits was its size; it was not only the largest dicynodont, but also the largest non-mammalian synapsid to have lived, rivalling the size of modern African Elephants.[1] In the place Lisowycia was discovered, there were no plateosaurid sauropodomorphs, which may explain why it could have reached comparable sizes; it could also have been also to support a larger gut for metabolic demands, among other possible causes.[2][3] Another trait that set it apart from other dicynodonts was that it had an erect gait, as opposed to a sprawling gait.[1] It inhabited a swampy wetland environment that was present in Poland during its time, and was the only large herbivore in its habitat.[3]",

    "Summary": "The 20mm/99 M61 Vulcan hydraulically/pneumatically-driven, electrically-fired, air-cooled, 20mm six-barrelled rotary cannon fires at an extremely high rate of between 4000 to 6000 rounds per minute. The Vulcan has been the main cannon armament of United States military combat aircraft for over fifty years. The several aircraft at the time were originally designed without an internal cannon, as it was believed that missiles had made guns obsolete; however, air-to-air combat experience in Vietnam showed that a gun could still be more effective than guided missiles in many combat situations, and that an externally carried gun pod was less effective than an internal gun, so the M61A1 Vulcan became standard as of the F-4E Phantom II. The initial M61 used linked, belted ammunition, but the ejection of spent links created considerable problems, and was soon replaced by the improved M61A1 with a linkless feed system. A lighter version of the Vulcan, the M61A2, was developed for use on the F-22 Raptor, which is mechanically the same as the M61A1 but with thinner barrels to reduce overall weight to 93 kilograms (202 pounds), allowing it to reach a slightly higher maximum rate of fire at 6600 rounds per minute. In addition to being mounted on the majority of combat aircraft, there also exist two land-based applications: the M163 Vulcan Air Defense System self-propelled anti-aircraft gun and the M167 Vulcan Air Defense System towed anti-aircraft gun.",

    "Summary": "Meepo the Dragon-Keeper was once the lowliest of kobolds, weak even for their lowly kind. As such, he was assigned by his then-master, Yusdrayl, to tend to the dragon their tribe had captured, who went by the name of Calcryx; this essentially meant Meepo was assigned to clean the dragon's feces. However, when the dragon was captured by the goblins who also lived in the same dungeon space (dubbed the Sunless Citadel), Meepo's reputation amongst his kin plummeted even lower, and he was destitute, until a party of adventurers arrived and assisted Meepo's tribe in re-capturing the dragon. This state of affairs lasted only briefly before the adventurers ultimately slew the dragon, killing all of Meepo's tribe as a consequence: only Meepo escaped.",

    "Summary": "Megacerops (\"Big horned face\") is a genus of large, rhinoceros-like perissodactyl that belongs to a unique family Brontotheriidae, which is related to horses. Their most distinctive feature is the large, blunt horn-like protrusion on their snout that takes on a forked \"Y\" shape. The \"horns\" in males were large as a form of sexual dimorphism, indicating social behavior such as intraspecific conflict.[1] This creature lived in North America 38–33.9 million years ago during the Late Eocene, and was adapted to a browsing lifestyle feeding on soft tree material.",

It is believed that a modern relative, the Komodo Dragon, evolved in Australia before having been displaced in Indonesia. Megalania is believed to be an apex predator back in Pleistocene-era Australia around 1.5 million to 40,000 years ago, although there is skepticism towards the claim. The Megalania ranged in length from 3.5 to 7 meters long. It had an estimated maximum weight of 1940 kg, although 320 kg seems to be the average weight of these creatures.[1]",

The exact classification of Megalodon has been disputed for decades, mostly concerning whether it should be placed in the species Carcharodon megalodon (thus classifying it as a relative of the great white shark) or the species Carcharocles megalodon. As this debate is still unresolved, the creature's full name is currently referred to as Otadus megalodon. Whatever its classification, it was one of the largest and most powerful predatory fish ever to live.",

It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It was commonly called the Me 109, most often by Allied aircrew and among the German aces, even though this was not the official German designation.",

    "Summary": "The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is an African crocodile, the largest freshwater predator in Africa, and may be considered the second-largest extant reptile and crocodilian in the world, after the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). The Nile crocodile is quite widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, occurring mostly in the central, eastern, and southern regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and marshlands. Although capable of living in saline environments, this species is rarely found in saltwater, but occasionally inhabits deltas and brackish lakes. The range of this species once stretched northward throughout the Nile, as far north as the Nile delta. On average, the adult male Nile crocodile is between 3.5 and 5 m (11.5 and 16.4 ft) in length and weighs 225 to 750 kg (500 to 1,650 lb). However, specimens exceeding 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and weighing up to 1,090 kg (2,400 lb) have been recorded. Sexual dimorphism is prevalent, and females are usually about 30% smaller than males. They have thick, scaly, heavily armored skin.",

These sea reptiles were likely related to plesiosaurs and pliosaurs that would later emerge, with Nothosaur-like reptiles thought to have given rise to them.",

Along with walruses, they also display convergent evolution with narwhals, with their skulls being entirely toothless aside from these tusks.",

Despite its superficial resemblance to big cats, it is not a feline, nor is it a carnivoran either; instead, it was an oxyaenid, a group of carnivorous mammals that were apex predators during the Eocene. Unlike carnivorans, it had stiffened vertebrae similar to armadillos or pangolins, thought to be a tradeoff of flexibility for larger size.[1] In life, they would have been terrestrial apex predators adapted for hunting on the forest floor.[2]",

    "Summary": "I recall my life upon the surface with more than regret. I weep for the decades spent treading the murky waters of profanity while my true Queen waited in the shadows. Even my name, ‘Eliette’, feels foreign and foul upon my tongue. A high elf exalted by Lolth herself - my drow captors cannot fathom it. But I see their house's downfall in visions granted by the Spider Queen herself. When that day comes, when some unnamed whelp from an insignificant house cuts the matron mother's throat, I will escape. I will find solitude, and I will worship Lolth with my very soul.",

It is a further development and modification of the PK machine gun. It is said to be more accurate than all its predecessors due to a heavier, non-removable, forced-air-cooling barrel with radial cooling ribs and a handle which eliminates the haze effect from hot gases and keeps the barrel cooler, making the weapon more reliable. Furthermore, the weapon is capable of having a telescopic sight or other sights mounted on it, which increases its accuracy and effective range.",

    "Summary": "The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle,[1][2][3] encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses.[4][5] It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures,[6] for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals,[6][7][8] which make up most of its diet.[3] Although most polar bears are born on land,[9] they spend most of their time on the sea ice.[10] Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\" and derives from this fact.[2] Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice,[3] often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.[2]",

Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas.",

    "Summary": "Quasits are miniscule demons from the Abyss, and are known to be particularly insidious due to their lack of impressive physical might. Their small stature and cowardly nature makes them perfectly suited as familiars of malevolent spellcasters, or perhaps contacts with the agents of the Abyss. Though they hunger for power and influence as all demons do, they are unable to achieve it. Quasits are known to adapt guerrilla tactics when they do have to take up combat, preferring to assault an enemy from an invisible state and then run before they're aware of what happened.",

    "Summary": "The Rheinmetall 120mm gun is a smoothbore tank gun designed and produced by the West German Rheinmetall-DeTec AG company, developed in response to Soviet advances in armor technology and development of new armored threats. Production began in 1974, with the first version of the gun, known as the L/44 as it was 44 calibers long, used on the German Leopard 2 tank and soon produced under license for the American M1A1 Abrams and other tanks. The 120-millimeter gun has a length of 5.28 meters, and the gun system weighs approximately 3,317 kilograms. A variety of ammunition has been developed for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warhead warheads. Recent ammunition includes a wide range of new anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions, giving tanks armed with the L/44 and its derivatives greater versatility on the modern battlefield. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armor and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.",

    "Summary": "Sawn-Off Shotgun A sawed-off shotgun (US, CAN) also called a sawn-off shotgun (UK, IRL, AU, NZ) and a short-barreled shotgun (SBS) (U.S. legislative terminology), is a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel—typically under 18 inches—and often a shortened or absent stock. Despite the colloquial term, barrels do not, strictly speaking, have to be shortened with a saw. Barrels can be manufactured at shorter lengths as an alternative to traditional, longer barrels. This makes them easier to transport due to their smaller profile and lighter weight. The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces, a feature sought by military close quarters combat units, law enforcement SWAT team users, and home defense purposes. As a result of the shorter barrel length, any sawed-off shotgun with a magazine tube will have its capacity reduced.",

    "Summary": "The SIG Sauer P320 is a modular semi-automatic pistol made by SIG Sauer, Inc. of Exeter, New Hampshire, and SIG Sauer GmbH of Eckernförde, Germany. It is a further development of the SIG Sauer P250, utilizing a striker-fired mechanism in lieu of a double action only hammer system. The P320 can be chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, .357 SIG, .40 S&W and .45 ACP, and can be easily converted from one caliber to another—a change from .357 SIG to .40 S&W requires only a barrel change; a change between 9mm to .357 SIG or .40 S&W and vice versa are accomplished using a caliber exchange kit.",

One night, Tores and some of her friends picked Angelo up to cruise, but it turned into a drive-by shooting. The stress of the incident caused Angelo's powers to manifest, and he passed out. He woke up with the car on fire, Tores' friend Gordo dead, and Tores gone. A homeless man was trying to steal Angelo's wallet while he was sleeping, and, as Angelo fled the burning car, it exploded, killing the man. With his wallet found on the unidentifiable corpse of the homeless man, Angelo Espinosa was declared legally dead. None of his friends or family were aware of this and many truly believed him to be dead.

One day Peter saw an Ariguan spaceship land, and his mother was killed by the aliens. When he told the police his mother had been killed by aliens, no one believed him and he was put in a state orphanage. He ran off when he was fifteen and eventually became a trainee NASA astronaut. When the alien entity called the Master of the Sun visited the space station that Quill was stationed at and offered the mantle of Star-Lord to a worthy candidate, Quill volunteered, but was rejected in favour of another astronaut. Quill was outraged, stole a scoutship, and on returning to the space station took his colleague's place. Quill was then chosen to become Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which he was able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called \"Ship\", Quill commenced his role as Star-Lord.",

    "Summary": "The Thylacine is a carnivorous marsupial that once lived throughout Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. It is nicknamed the Tasmania wolf due to its canine like features that arose from convergent evolution; the Tasmanian tiger nickname comes from its striped appearance. These creatures first emerged around 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago, during the early Pleistocene.[1] Around 3,200 years ago, the Thylacine population on mainland Australia would have died off, the major causes thought to be human activity and the introduction of dingoes.[2] Populations would remain prevalent on the island of Tasmania up until the early 20th century, before extermination by farmers and bounty hunters, along with habitat loss, competition from wild dogs, and disease would devastate them (with possibly already low genetic diversity worsening their chances of survival).[3] The last Thylacine was captured and kept in Hobart Zoo until he died on September 7, 1936.",

Due to his successful operations around the world, Walker was chosen to succeed Steve Rogers as the second Captain America. However, his aspirations of living up to Rogers' legacy attracted the ire of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes in their pursuit of the Flag Smashers, during which he took the Super Soldier Serum after failing to apprehend Karli Morgenthau. When his partner and best friend Lemar Hoskins was killed in action, Walker brutally murdered a surrendering foreign national in public, leading to him being stripped of his mantle and discharged from the United States Army with total loss of rank. Walker confronted Morgenthau again in New York City but chose to abandon his revenge to join Wilson and Barnes in thwarting her attack on the GRC. Despite his discharge, Walker was recruited by government agent Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to continue serving America in secret as U.S. Agent.",

It was the first of the so-called \"Vengeance weapons\" series (V-weapons or Vergeltungswaffen), developed at Peenemünde Army Research Center in 1939 by the Nazi German Luftwaffe at the beginning of the Second World War, and was deployed at bombarding England. The thousands of V-1 missiles launched into England were fired from launch facilities along the French (Pas-de-Calais) and Dutch coasts. The existence of such a concept as cruise missile inspired the British to operate an arrangement of air defenses, including anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft, to intercept the bombs before they reached their targets, while the launch sites and underground storage depots became targets for Allied attacks including strategic bombing.",

Dixon even took a perverse pleasure in such activities.

Claire is a survivor of the Raccoon City Incident, which took place in September 1998 after she traveled to the city in search of her brother. After escaping the city with the help of Leon S. Kennedy, Claire ventured to Europe to resume her search for Chris. In December, she was captured by Umbrella after infiltrating their Paris Laboratory and transported to the Umbrella owned Rockfort Island and imprisoned. When Rockfort Island was attacked by a mysterious Special Forces group, Claire tried to escape with a fellow prisoner, Steve Burnside, leading to both of their involvements in the Antarctic outbreak. Her brother soon learned of her situation and rescued her. In 2005, Claire confronted the t-Virus again when she arrived at Harvardville Airport to meet some friends. While surviving in the airport, she was reunited with Leon, now a U.S. Government agent, who had been sent to deal with the outbreak. Later, in 2011, Claire would be kidnapped along with other TerraSave members by Alex Wesker's organization and left on Sushestvovanie Island, which made her try to escape with Moira Burton amid the outbreak taking place there. Having been the only one to be rescued, she would eventually support Barry Burton in the search for his daughter and in the process participated in the elimination of the last of the Wesker Children. As early as 2014, in the midst of her investigation into bioterrorist activities taking place in the Sonido de Tortuga Island region, Claire was eventually involved in the outbreak that occurred at the site.",

They are distinguishable by their resemblance to corpses caused by the extensive necrosis on their skin and body. Originally created by Umbrella scientists as result of experimentation, they would rarely be seen in action up until 1998, the year the first viral outbreak was caused deliberately by former Umbrella scientist James Marcus, resulting in the infection of most of Umbrella's employees located in the Arklay Mountains. The actions of the now infected would lead to the intervention of S.T.A.R.S. police force which resulted in the Ecliptic Express and Mansion Incidents, where several members of the team would be brutally murdered by the infected.",

This came to a head when Ozai punished him for a perceived slight by horrifically burning his face and sending him into exile, refusing to let him return until he had captured the Avatar. (This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",

That's what Cade Yeager believes when he looks at his daughter, to whom he and his girlfriend gave birth at the cost of their high school graduation. While Cade is not the most responsible father in the world, his most redeeming quality is that when it comes to keeping his daughter safe, he does not go back on his word, no matter what; a promise he made to his bride before she passed away. He does have a creative and optimistic mind, lending it to building all kinds of inventions to make a good business out of. Sadly, none of these inventions have brought in much profit for his family. Knowing all of the opportunities he lost, he has sworn not to let history repeat itself, which is probably why he disapproves of Tessa dating boys before she graduates from high school.",

Dragon, a revolutionary considered “The World's Most Dangerous Criminal”; the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, a powerful Marine Vice-Admiral who had cornered the late Pirate King himself on several occasions; the sworn brother of late \"Fire Fist\" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo; and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which gives him stretching powers that he has become quite a master of and he's quite creative with them as he has developed two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack.",

    "Summary": "The Diamond Dogs were a PMC (Private Military Contractor) formed by Kazuhira Miller in the early 1980s, and commanded from 1984 onwards by Venom Snake, after recovering from his coma. Under his command, it would become an extremely powerful and highly influential player in the worldwide military-industrial complex, taking on jobs for all clients. The organization would end up at odds with XOF, the covert strike force of the shadow government known as The Patriots, due to the feud between Big Boss/Venom Snake and XOF's leader, Skull Face. Ultimately, Diamond Dogs would emerge victorious, with Venom Snake and Kazuhira Miller dealing the finishing blows to Skull Face and scattering XOF. The PMC would remain in operation for roughly a decade more, before being supplanted and its strength absorbed by Big Boss' military fortress nation, Outer Heaven.",

Due to conspiratorial acts at the top of government, Kimblee is officially exonerated of his crimes so as to serve as the Führer's hidden left hand in the secret battles to come.",

While at a young age, Bruce was left with no family when his parents and older brother were attacked and killed by gangsters. With no other family to turn to, Bruce was forced to survive, alone, on the streets. This did not break him, however, and knowing that he had to be strong to survive, Bruce trained in the art of Muay Thai kickboxing. Forced to fight on a daily basis to survive on the mean streets, Bruce turned this to his advantage by competing in the underground fight scene to earn money, where he soon developed a fearsome reputation due to his vicious temperament and uncompromising technique. This led Bruce to compete in professional tournaments, where he soon became the undisputed heavyweight champion.",

He does have a creative and optimistic mind, lending it to building all kinds of inventions to make a good business out of. Sadly, none of these inventions have brought in much profit for his family. Knowing all of the opportunities he lost, he has sworn not to let history repeat itself, which is probably why he disapproves of Tessa dating boys before she graduates from high school.",

    "Summary": "Claire Redfield is a current member of the human rights organization, TerraSave. She is the younger sister of BSAA operative and former S.T.A.R.S. member Chris Redfield. Claire is a survivor of the Raccoon City Incident, which took place in September 1998 after she traveled to the city in search of her brother. After escaping the city with the help of Leon S. Kennedy, Claire ventured to Europe to resume her search for Chris. In December, she was captured by Umbrella after infiltrating their Paris Laboratory and transported to the Umbrella owned Rockfort Island and imprisoned. When Rockfort Island was attacked by a mysterious Special Forces group, Claire tried to escape with a fellow prisoner, Steve Burnside, leading to both of their involvements in the Antarctic outbreak. Her brother soon learned of her situation and rescued her. In 2005, Claire confronted the t-Virus again when she arrived at Harvardville Airport to meet some friends. While surviving in the airport, she was reunited with Leon, now a U.S. Government agent, who had been sent to deal with the outbreak. Later, in 2011, Claire would be kidnapped along with other TerraSave members by Alex Wesker's organization and left on Sushestvovanie Island, which made her try to escape with Moira Burton amid the outbreak taking place there. Having been the only one to be rescued, she would eventually support Barry Burton in the search for his daughter and in the process participated in the elimination of the last of the Wesker Children. As early as 2014, in the midst of her investigation into bioterrorist activities taking place in the Sonido de Tortuga Island region, Claire was eventually involved in the outbreak that occurred at the site.",

When their plan was exposed by the Earth Defense Force, the Xilien Commander was assassinated and usurped by his subordinate who became the Controller of Planet X. The Controller unleashed all of the Xiliens' mind-controlled kaiju on Earth and tried to eliminate all resistance, but the surviving members of the EDF used the Gotengo to free Godzilla from his prison in Antarctica. Godzilla swiftly eliminated most of the Xiliens' monsters before the Controller summoned his ultimate weapon, Monster X, to stop him. The Gotengo breached the Xilien Mothership and its crew were able to defeat the Controller and his minions. In a final act, the Controller set the Mothership to self-destruct, but the Gotengo was able to escape in time and help Godzilla overcome Monster X's final form, Keizer Ghidorah.",

This came to a head when Ozai punished him for a perceived slight by horrifically burning his face and sending him into exile, refusing to let him return until he had captured the Avatar. (This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",
