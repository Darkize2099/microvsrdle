Immediately, the god fled, but the youth was struck by his presence, and came to despair when she failed to find him. Another god came to her aid, and taught her the song of the birds in an attempt to lure the other deity back. After failing, the elf maiden cursed the gods, and became the first Harpy.",

When he told the police his mother had been killed by aliens, no one believed him and he was put in a state orphanage. He ran off when he was fifteen and eventually became a trainee NASA astronaut. When the alien entity called the Master of the Sun visited the space station that Quill was stationed at and offered the mantle of Star-Lord to a worthy candidate, Quill volunteered, but was rejected in favour of another astronaut. Quill was outraged, stole a scoutship, and on returning to the space station took his colleague's place. Quill was then chosen to become Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which he was able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called \"Ship\", Quill commenced his role as Star-Lord.",

Unlike Vox and Valentino, Velvette poses no threat to the main cast, and she only serves as an irritation for the other Overlords of Hell such as Carmilla Carmine and Zestial.",

Immediately, the god fled, but the youth was struck by his presence, and came to despair when she failed to find him. Another god came to her aid, and taught her the song of the birds in an attempt to lure the other deity back. After failing, the elf maiden cursed the gods, and became the first Harpy.",

Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (480 km/h), are more than two miles (3 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).",

Despite his demeanor and image, Snart was among the most warm-hearted villains on the street, showing compassion for those in need, and truly loved his friends and sister, though rarely let them know it.",

The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

    "Summary": "Mitchell Mayo, once an average guy went inexplicably crazy and donned the identity of the Condiment King to cause crime. He was shown tormenting multiple policemen with his special designed sauce, until he was swiftly defeated by Batgirl and Robin. He was then taken to Arkham Asylum, where he eventually was able to work in the kitchen and fuel his obsession, as well as improve upon his formula. This was further aided by Poison Ivy, who taught him vast knowledge on roots, herbs, and spices. Years later, he would get out of Arkham and be \"jokerized\". Jokerization is stated to amplify the infected's personality, which actually made Mitchell a credible threat. This would almost cause the Birds of Prey to lose to him, as they though he was a joke. It is later stated due to the nature of Condiment King's obsession/portrayal as a joke, juries and parole boards don't take him seriously, thus allowing him to be set free on Gotham again and again. During Final Crisis Aftermath, Mitchell was one of Immortus' followers, The Army of the Endangered, and was cybernetically enhanced by the brilliant Professor Achilles Milo. He was the one to introduce the \"Human Flame\" to the group, which would be a mistake. Human Flame would rebel, and along with Seductress, kill every member of The Army of the Endangered, including Mitchell.",

    "Summary": "Erik Stevens (born N'Jadaka) was a former American black-ops soldier of Wakandan origin through his father, Prince N'Jobu. His savagery while serving in the US black-ops earned him the nickname Erik Killmonger. Years after T'Chaka killed his father for betraying Wakanda, Killmonger then planned to forcibly dethrone T'Challa in order to accomplish his father's plan to use Wakanda's technology to conquer the world via imperialistic, supremacist, world-spanning, and likely genocidal warfare, to stop what he perceived to be the oppression of people of African descent by the world. Manipulating and then killing Ulysses Klaue to gain access to their city, Killmonger seemingly killed T'Challa during ritual combat and took the throne, but just before Killmonger unleashed his plan, the Black Panther had returned and challenged Killmonger, eventually killing him in their final battle.",

They were most often encountered on the Prime Material, hiding themselves as boulders unless someone invaded their territories (though they typically allied themselves with other defenders of nature, such as treants or pech). They spent their days endlessly tending to their boulders, much like a gardener might tend to their plants. They were often called upon by druids to protect groves and other places sacred to nature, and used their innate camouflage abilities to remain staunch in their sentinel duty, sitting still for years at a time.",

At thirteen years of age, Shishido had devised a mathematical formula that without question, proved the existence of God, but this revelation changed Shishido in a catastrophic manner. Believing that God's existence hindered mankind as man would be little more than subservient slaves if God existed, Shishido began to hate all gods, and began to desire to kill a god, along with all life on earth. During this time, Shishido learned he had the mutant power to turn people into stone with a glance, and the Japanese media dubbed him \"Gorgon.\" Shortly after this, Gorgon formed the \"Dawn of the White Light,\" a mutant death cult that subjected Japan to relentless terror attacks to complete their mission of ending all life. At eighteen years old, he searched for the Hand, drawing their attention by killing all of his loved ones, and committing suicide to prove his dedication to the organization. The Hand resurrected Gorgon promptly after this, and within a short time he became their leader, allowing him to continue his mission of ending all life.",

He became corrupted and opposed the Ancient One and his former brothers-in-arms when he felt his mentor had failed in her promise to help him find meaning to his wife and son's tragic deaths or found a way to bring them back together. Becoming angered by this, Kaecilius rebelled against his allies and formed the Zealots, aiming to find their meaning in the Mystic Arts that the Ancient One was hiding from them. He and his followers then stole a few pages of the Book of Cagliostro from Kamar-Taj's library as part of his scheme to summon Dormammu of the Dark Dimension to Earth. He is ultimately defeated when Dormammu accepts Doctor Strange's bargain to leave Earth and take the souls of Kaecilius and his minions with him in return for freedom from the time-loop that Strange created.",

Begin the ballet of murder and watch masters of the art at work, the challenge lying not in the numbers of the attackers, but in their skill and silent determination... and devotion to the death of their foe. Yet this is no ordinary foe... nor even an ordinary master of the martial arts, for he has not the skills learned of a single art, but those of all... and from birth he has given his life over to their total mastery... until his every move shows that he is more than the master of the art from which he takes his name. His moves show the blood of the great black dragon in his veins... and the stern teachings of the sensei who made him a force for good. He is the complete fighting machine in human form... a true champion of combat... Val Armorr, the Karate Kid!",

It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It was commonly called the Me 109, most often by Allied aircrew and among the German aces, even though this was not the official German designation.",

They serve countless masters- their own Rajahs, demon lords[1], yugoloths, night hags, and even the mightiest of devils. As manipulators and masterminds, the Rakshasa ply their trade from their luxuriously decorated palaces, subtly tipping the scales in planar and political conflicts as it suited their wants.",

While she came close to defeating him, he convinced her to temporarily side with him. While nominally on Andrew's side, Tig would often be a wrench in his plans, even killing him at one point, and after his return, he turned her into his vampire minion while under an evil curse. Tig finally found her death at the hands of Cain, who briefly used her body to resurrect his wife Lilith, but was quickly defeated alongside her by Andrew and Mary.",

Fast and heavily armed, the Baltimore cruisers were mainly used in World War II to protect the fast aircraft carriers in battle groups from air attack. Additionally, their 8\"/55 (203mm) main guns and secondary 5\"/38 (127mm) guns were regularly used to bombard land targets in support of amphibious landings. After the war, only six Baltimores and two Oregon City-class ships remained in service, while the rest were moved to the reserve fleet.",

He grew up in the prison, and killing one of his fellow prisoners, the guards bestowed a name upon him: Bane. The prison guards locked Bane in a pit for ten years as penance, expecting him to die, but he survived and became a legend to the other inmates. Bane trained his mind and his body and was eventually chosen as a test subject for a drug called Venom. Bane was the only subject who survived the test, and he was subsequently given surgery so the drug could be injected directly into his brain. After faking his own death to escape Peña Duro, Bane returned to free the inmates, kill the warden and steal a helicopter so he could travel to Gotham City, home of the man that Bane wanted to destroy: the Batman.",

    "Summary": "Born acromegalic, Preston Payne was frequently mocked and ridiculed by his peers at a young age. However, what he lacked in appearance, he made up for in his exceptionally acute intellect, graduating at the top of his class and quickly securing a job at S.T.A.R Labs. Desperate to cure his physical deformities, Payne sought out the world's foremost cosmetic surgeons but to no anvil, until he learnt of the shapeshifting Matt Hagen. Using his blood, Preston would develop and brilliant serum that would seemingly allow him to remould the very thing he despised the most, however, instead it would drive him insane, turning him into the third bearer of the mantle of Clayface.",

    "Summary": "The Cleveland-class light cruisers were built for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

He was shown tormenting multiple policemen with his special designed sauce, until he was swiftly defeated by Batgirl and Robin. He was then taken to Arkham Asylum, where he eventually was able to work in the kitchen and fuel his obsession, as well as improve upon his formula. This was further aided by Poison Ivy, who taught him vast knowledge on roots, herbs, and spices. Years later, he would get out of Arkham and be \"jokerized\". Jokerization is stated to amplify the infected's personality, which actually made Mitchell a credible threat. This would almost cause the Birds of Prey to lose to him, as they though he was a joke. It is later stated due to the nature of Condiment King's obsession/portrayal as a joke, juries and parole boards don't take him seriously, thus allowing him to be set free on Gotham again and again. During Final Crisis Aftermath, Mitchell was one of Immortus' followers, The Army of the Endangered, and was cybernetically enhanced by the brilliant Professor Achilles Milo. He was the one to introduce the \"Human Flame\" to the group, which would be a mistake. Human Flame would rebel, and along with Seductress, kill every member of The Army of the Endangered, including Mitchell.",

Years after T'Chaka killed his father for betraying Wakanda, Killmonger then planned to forcibly dethrone T'Challa in order to accomplish his father's plan to use Wakanda's technology to conquer the world via imperialistic, supremacist, world-spanning, and likely genocidal warfare, to stop what he perceived to be the oppression of people of African descent by the world. Manipulating and then killing Ulysses Klaue to gain access to their city, Killmonger seemingly killed T'Challa during ritual combat and took the throne, but just before Killmonger unleashed his plan, the Black Panther had returned and challenged Killmonger, eventually killing him in their final battle.",

As a boy, his parents were taken prisoner by the Empire, leaving Bridger to fend for himself on the streets of Lothal. He joined the rebel crew of the Ghost five years before the Battle of Yavin and, with his Force-sensitivity having been discovered, became the apprentice of Kanan Jarrus, a Jedi who survived Order 66. Bridger's abilities with the Force grew quickly, which aided in many of the crew's efforts against the Empire.",

Not unlike maggots or Carrion Crawlers, they sweep to the scent of freshly killed flesh in droves to devour and consume. The first ghoul was made when Doresain, an elf worshiper of Orcus, consumed human flesh. As a reward, Orcus granted him a domain in his layer of the Abyss- however, this was lost when Yeenoghu overthrew Doresain. When Orcus failed to act on his behalf, Doresain turned back to the elf gods, who saved him from total annihilation once more.",

At thirteen years of age, Shishido had devised a mathematical formula that without question, proved the existence of God, but this revelation changed Shishido in a catastrophic manner. Believing that God's existence hindered mankind as man would be little more than subservient slaves if God existed, Shishido began to hate all gods, and began to desire to kill a god, along with all life on earth. During this time, Shishido learned he had the mutant power to turn people into stone with a glance, and the Japanese media dubbed him \"Gorgon.\" Shortly after this, Gorgon formed the \"Dawn of the White Light,\" a mutant death cult that subjected Japan to relentless terror attacks to complete their mission of ending all life. At eighteen years old, he searched for the Hand, drawing their attention by killing all of his loved ones, and committing suicide to prove his dedication to the organization. The Hand resurrected Gorgon promptly after this, and within a short time he became their leader, allowing him to continue his mission of ending all life.",

Considered meddlers and unwanted interruptions by the bulk of the religious community, they interfere with the devils' pact with the gods themselves, demanding safety for souls tainted by their fiendish ways. As such, Halagrad maintains immense knowledge on Baator- its politics and policies are known to the Soulguard, who must battle them on this front.",

Immediately, the god fled, but the youth was struck by his presence, and came to despair when she failed to find him. Another god came to her aid, and taught her the song of the birds in an attempt to lure the other deity back. After failing, the elf maiden cursed the gods, and became the first Harpy.",

He is ultimately defeated when Dormammu accepts Doctor Strange's bargain to leave Earth and take the souls of Kaecilius and his minions with him in return for freedom from the time-loop that Strange created.",

The Bf 109 first saw operational service in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II in 1945. It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It was commonly called the Me 109, most often by Allied aircrew and among the German aces, even though this was not the official German designation.",

He was ultimately defeated by the new Black Panther and forced to yield, still expecting that eventually, Wakanda would ask for his help.",

He slowly climbed the ranks of demonhood after his demise until he became Orcus, demon lord of the damned.

It is said that he is one of (if not the most) powerful demon lord, with massive physical strength coming from his massive frame (standing 15 ft tall and weighing 6,000 lbs).",

    "Summary": "Pietro Maximoff was a native of the Eastern European country of Sokovia who grew up with his fraternal twin sister, Wanda. The country, which was embroiled in constant war and strife, became the base of operations for a HYDRA cell operated by Wolfgang von Strucker, who recruited Pietro and Wanda to take part in a series of tests involving the Scepter, giving the twins superpowers. While his sister received a number of mental abilities, Pietro acquired the ability to move at supersonic speeds and other physical features. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined the A.I. Ultron to continue their quest for revenge on Tony Stark, but eventually switched sides and helped the Avengers when they discovered Ultron's true intentions. Pietro then fought in the Battle of Sokovia alongside all of the other Avengers, but later sacrificed his own life to protect Hawkeye and a civilian boy named Costel, much to his sister's grief.",

When he told the police his mother had been killed by aliens, no one believed him and he was put in a state orphanage. He ran off when he was fifteen and eventually became a trainee NASA astronaut. When the alien entity called the Master of the Sun visited the space station that Quill was stationed at and offered the mantle of Star-Lord to a worthy candidate, Quill volunteered, but was rejected in favour of another astronaut. Quill was outraged, stole a scoutship, and on returning to the space station took his colleague's place. Quill was then chosen to become Star-Lord, with the Master of the Sun first creating an illusion in which he was able to find and kill the aliens that murdered his mother to free him of his past. Equipped with a sentient vessel called \"Ship\", Quill commenced his role as Star-Lord.",

Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel originating from the base of a huge storm cloud, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a basal cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (480 km/h), are more than two miles (3 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).",

One day, Emil was performing surgery on mobster Gabe Granno, when Granno's rival Neal Jennings burst in and forced Emil's scalpel down, fatally wounding Granno. Jennings then threatened to accuse Emil of murdering Granno if he did not flee the country. Fearing persecution, Emil and Robert left America and partook in a medical expedition in Cameroon. There, Robert contracted a rare tropical virus and was near death. Trying to save his son via blood transfusion from his own body, Emil became delirious and irrational. Determined to save the life of his son, Emil witnessed a mongoose fighting off a killing a cobra, only to be fatally wounded itself. Believing local folklore about the recuperative properties of the mongoose, Emil used the animal in a transfusion, reviving his son. Emil soon died from a combination of the blood transfusions and shock. Robert meanwhile found that he was endowed with super-human speed. Although initially believed that the mongoose blood was the source of his super-human powers, later reports suggest that the mongoose blood was actually a catalyst that triggered latent mutant abilities within Robert.",

Him and his best friend Chris McCarthy were tasked with guarding Dr. Henry Pym's lab by a higher ranking agent, Mitch Carson. When Pym went to leave the lab, Eric and Chris panicked and Eric attacked Pym, knocking him unconscious. Inside the lab, they found the most recent version of Ant-Man's Suit, which Chris put on and promptly activated, shrinking down. Thinking him gone, Eric panicked again and ran off, only to run into each other as a Hydra siege infiltrated the Helicarrier. While trying to find a safe place to hide, Chris was killed, and Eric took the Ant-Man's Suit off his body. Surviving the Helicarrier crash, Eric kept the suit and operated as Ant-Man.",

The vampiric corruption reached Eric through the umbilical chord, and turned him into a unique being with a vengeance against the vampiric kind, who would all eventually come to fear him.",

    "Summary": "The Cleveland-class light cruisers were built for the U.S. Navy during World War II, and were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. The ships were designed with the goal of increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, torpedo protection, etc., compared with earlier U.S. cruisers. Fifty-two ships of this class were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the Independence class, and two of them were completed to a somewhat different design, called the Fargo class. The Fargo-class cruisers were a modified version of the previous Cleveland-class cruiser design; the main difference was a more compact pyramidal superstructure with single trunked funnel, intended to improve the arcs of fire of the anti-aircraft guns. In all, 13 Fargo-class ships were planned but only Fargo and Huntington were ever completed, the rest being cancelled at varying states of completion with the de-escalation of World War II. Of the 27 Cleveland-class cruisers that were commissioned, one (Galveston) was completed as a guided missile cruiser and five were later modified as Galveston and Providence-class guided missile cruisers. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for US cities and towns.",

    "Summary": "Born in Schenectady, New York, Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing due to his abusive father Torbert berating him for being constantly bullied at school. Due to his mother's insistence that he could solve anything with his mind rather than with brute force, Otto focused more on his education, becoming a brilliant and respected nuclear physicist who devoted his entire life to developing a fusion-based energy source. His work eventually led him to Oscorp. By the time Octavius finally finished his fusion reactor for Oscorp, having lost his mother and the woman he loved during that time, he unveiled a harness of highly advanced mechanical arms controlled via a brain–computer interface to assist him with his research into atomic physics.",

She goes by the name Spider-Woman and much like Spider-Man of Earth 616 used her newly found powers to for more personal gain rather than helping people by becoming a professional drummer. Peter Parker remained a weak individual that Gwen needed to save from bullying. This made him develop an inferiority complex causing him to create a serum to make himself more like Gwen after she has revealed to him her powers. This causes him to become Earth 65's version of the Lizard and Gwen is forced to fight him. Unfortunately due to the serum during the battle Peter dies and she vows to use her powers for good. Unfortunately, Gwen is blamed for Peter's death and a campaign against her (spearheaded by J. Jonah Jameson) is started.",

Immediately, the god fled, but the youth was struck by his presence, and came to despair when she failed to find him. Another god came to her aid, and taught her the song of the birds in an attempt to lure the other deity back. After failing, the elf maiden cursed the gods, and became the first Harpy.",

In his Inhuman city, Lash was one of the few in his generation selected to be worthy of undergoing this change. Thus, he gained the ability to absorb energy and subsequently emit it from his hands. However, after the detonation of the Terrigen Bomb, Terrigen Mist was unleashed upon the world everywhere, with new Inhumans being born every day. Lash, believing that not everybody should receive this gift, set out to correct the mistake, putting him in conflict with the Inhuman Royal Family.",

Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel originating from the base of a huge storm cloud, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a basal cloud of debris and dust. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300 miles per hour (480 km/h), are more than two miles (3 km) in diameter, and stay on the ground for dozens of miles (more than 100 km).",

One day, Emil was performing surgery on mobster Gabe Granno, when Granno's rival Neal Jennings burst in and forced Emil's scalpel down, fatally wounding Granno. Jennings then threatened to accuse Emil of murdering Granno if he did not flee the country. Fearing persecution, Emil and Robert left America and partook in a medical expedition in Cameroon. There, Robert contracted a rare tropical virus and was near death. Trying to save his son via blood transfusion from his own body, Emil became delirious and irrational. Determined to save the life of his son, Emil witnessed a mongoose fighting off a killing a cobra, only to be fatally wounded itself. Believing local folklore about the recuperative properties of the mongoose, Emil used the animal in a transfusion, reviving his son. Emil soon died from a combination of the blood transfusions and shock. Robert meanwhile found that he was endowed with super-human speed. Although initially believed that the mongoose blood was the source of his super-human powers, later reports suggest that the mongoose blood was actually a catalyst that triggered latent mutant abilities within Robert.",

While she worked with Cinder, she initially appeared to be affable and disarmingly friendly, however, this belies a darker side of her character. On the whole, she seemed to be genuinely outgoing and quick-witted, if a little short-fused. She had a tendency to maintain a pretense of friendliness amongst people in order to gain their trust, and showed a strong sense of loyalty, specifically to Cinder, whom she appeared incredibly eager to please. However, Emerald eventually had a change of heart and joined Ruby and her friends after learning from Ozpin about Salem's true goals.",

On one occasion she saved the life of her daughter, who she had abandoned shortly after her birth, though not without warning that she won't be looking out for her a second time. Raven is currently concerned about Salem and the power that she possesses.",

As Tabuu cannot leave Subspace, most of the forces are located in the World of Trophy while Tabuu manipulates them from Subspace. Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",

His weapon is a collapsible staff that separates into two pairs of nunchucks made of guns called Ruyi Bang and Jingu Bang. In his first appearance, Sun is shown to be fun-loving and mischievous, with little regard for the law - stowing away on a ship, thanking the crew for the ride during his escape, throwing a banana peel in a detective's face, and stealing apples. He has a lot of self-confidence, referring to himself as a \"great stowaway\". He is also a bit of a flirt towards Blake. In conversation, Sun is very laid-back and casual. He is also kind and patient, willing to listen to Blake's story and waiting for her to do so for nearly two days, bearing with her \"small talk and weird looks\". He is not afraid to give his opinion and has a dislike for those who regard themselves as \"holier than thou\", or who \"use force to get whatever they want\", such as the White Fang. Sun also seems to be willing to help others, regardless of whether he is asked or not, even if he barely knows them. This quality is further demonstrated when he readily volunteers to help Team RWBY with their investigation, despite both Blake and Ruby stating their opposition to his involvement.",

He's the son of Yasopp, a sharpshooter serving under Shanks, and comes from the East Blue. Usopp had a reputation on his home island of being a serial liar who claimed that pirates were attacking, which came back to haunt him when real pirates actually attacked. He's a rather boastful seventeen/nineteen-year-old who likes to tell tall tales (several of which actually do come true, after a fashion), though he's more prone to hiding behind the stronger crew members such as Zoro when he actually gets into a fight. However, when push comes to shove, he is very dependable. He specializes in the use of a slingshot, called the Galaxy Slingshot (Ginga Pachinko), which he replaced with the Kabuto and later the Black Kabuto. This slingshot, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies, and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.",

Both the Schnee Dust Company and the Schnee family have been targets of the White Fang terrorist organization for years, leading to Weiss' inherent distrust of the Faunus. Weiss chose to become a Huntress over taking a job at SDC to restore her family's honor, as her father caused the company to decline. At the start of the show, she was shown as self-centered, standoffish, and an obnoxious know-it-all, but has matured somewhat throughout the show. She has a noticeable scar over her left eye, which she is assumed to have acquired in a fight against a living suit of armor in the 'White Trailer'. As of Volume 4, she is the former heiress of the Schnee Dust Company.",

Despite being the eldest child, Winter's right to inherit the Schnee Dust Company was abdicated upon her decision to join the Atlas Military. At first glance, Winter appears to be cold, dignified, and distant, preferring to keep her emotions subdued and speaking in a very high-class, eloquent, almost robotic fashion. However, when interacting with Weiss, she smiles and shows that she cares about her younger sister's life and well-being. Although she strives to keep her emotions in check, she can be rather hot-headed at times. Once she becomes angry, she drops her dignified ladylike demeanor and loses all restraint. Winter consistently wrestles with her emotions, never letting them overpower her, yet still allowing them to guide her on what she believes to be a righteous path.",

More than memories made in one's image, it's within the little, tiny fragments that remain drifting off, where the value of life lies. It never had anything to do with the ways people die. I just couldn't ever forgive those who acted as if that value didn't exist. Sukuna... I loathe you. Humans aren't tools. We aren't born with any set role. Which is to say... I don't know. I don't know whether humans are fundamentally good or evil. I could very well be doing the wrong thing here. So I thought I should at least let you see the humanity of someone other than yourself.

This came to a head when Ozai punished him for a perceived slight by horrifically burning his face and sending him into exile, refusing to let him return until he had captured the Avatar. (This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",

He believes that Starscream is vital in their search for Megatron and the AllSpark. In many ways this makes him Starscream's closest ally in the naturally combative Decepticon ranks. Then again, it's been said that he likes to trick people into trusting him, just so he can see their reactions when they find out just how much of a bad idea it was. As such, he has disguised himself as an Earth police car in an attempt to fool the humans around him.",

In battle, her Semblance allows her to create a shadow of herself, an empty copy that distracts or takes hits from enemies for her while she moves in a different direction. Blake has a quiet nature and a love for books. She is a Faunus (a humanoid race with animal-like features) and a former member of the White Fang, a social rights advocacy group turned extremist paramilitary organization. However, she left in disgust of their violence and joined Beacon Academy to become a Huntress. Blake keeps her Faunus identity a secret by concealing her cat ears because she feels that she is not ready for the attention it would give her if the secret got out and doesn't want to face the discrimination other Faunus receive from humanity.",

Under his command, it would become an extremely powerful and highly influential player in the worldwide military-industrial complex, taking on jobs for all clients. The organization would end up at odds with XOF, the covert strike force of the shadow government known as The Patriots, due to the feud between Big Boss/Venom Snake and XOF's leader, Skull Face. Ultimately, Diamond Dogs would emerge victorious, with Venom Snake and Kazuhira Miller dealing the finishing blows to Skull Face and scattering XOF. The PMC would remain in operation for roughly a decade more, before being supplanted and its strength absorbed by Big Boss' military fortress nation, Outer Heaven.",

Thus, they enrolled her in an Atlas program and told her to disguise her Faunus heritage so she would fit in with the higher society. Managing to actually make some friends and blend in quite well, everything was going well until reports came in that the mines had suffered a cave-in which resulted in the deaths of her parents. Her friends simply laughed at the news, causing Ilia to uncontrollably change color and reveal her secret. Suddenly her so-called friends were afraid of her, and she assaulted them in retaliation.",

Arriving on Earth, Optimus met up with the other Autobots to give further commands to his troops. During the final battle against Megatron, Megatron set Allspark drones on Prime, but Create-A-Bot, who tailed Prime to the fight sacrificed himself to weaken Megatron. Galvanized by the rookie's sacrifice, Optimus fought Megatron in a final duel. After besting Megatron, Optimus decided the Allspark was worth sacrificing to stop Megatron. Megatron defeated, Optimus commended the dying young Autobot and swore he would always be remembered as a war hero, and sent out an interstellar message to any Autobots living among the stars to join them.",

    "Summary": "Ruby Rose is the 15-year old leader of Team RWBY attending Beacon Academy two years early, due to her abilities impressing Professor Ozpin. Trained by her Uncle Qrow, Ruby wields a unique weapon named Crescent Rose, a cross between a scythe and a high-caliber sniper rifle that is able to fold up into itself. Her Semblance is speed, enabling her to run at rates that are too fast for the eye to catch. As she is the youngest of the group, she can be a bit childish, naïve, and weapon-obsessed, but displays leadership qualities and an understanding of people that ultimately led her to be chosen as Team RWBY's leader. She was inspired to become a Huntress by the fairy tales her half-sister Yang read her, wanting to become just like the heroes in the stories. She is determined to make the world a better place for others and try to stop the forces that conspire against it.",

    "Summary": "Sun Wukong is a Faunus from the kingdom of Vacuo, who later moved to Mistral and made his first appearance in \"The Stray\". His weapon is a collapsible staff that separates into two pairs of nunchucks made of guns called Ruyi Bang and Jingu Bang. In his first appearance, Sun is shown to be fun-loving and mischievous, with little regard for the law - stowing away on a ship, thanking the crew for the ride during his escape, throwing a banana peel in a detective's face, and stealing apples. He has a lot of self-confidence, referring to himself as a \"great stowaway\". He is also a bit of a flirt towards Blake. In conversation, Sun is very laid-back and casual. He is also kind and patient, willing to listen to Blake's story and waiting for her to do so for nearly two days, bearing with her \"small talk and weird looks\". He is not afraid to give his opinion and has a dislike for those who regard themselves as \"holier than thou\", or who \"use force to get whatever they want\", such as the White Fang. Sun also seems to be willing to help others, regardless of whether he is asked or not, even if he barely knows them. This quality is further demonstrated when he readily volunteers to help Team RWBY with their investigation, despite both Blake and Ruby stating their opposition to his involvement.",

The relationship between villages is unknown, but they are likely in somewhat friendly terms due to neighboring villages capable of easily fusing into one.Their lifestyle is passive, as they spend most of their times on local farms and shops. However, their access to Nether-exclusive goods and their possession of maps leading to faraway places such as the Water Temples seems to hint that some of them may be more adventurous than usual.",

This came to a head when Ozai punished him for a perceived slight by horrifically burning his face and sending him into exile, refusing to let him return until he had captured the Avatar. (This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",

While surviving in the airport, she was reunited with Leon, now a U.S. Government agent, who had been sent to deal with the outbreak. Later, in 2011, Claire would be kidnapped along with other TerraSave members by Alex Wesker's organization and left on Sushestvovanie Island, which made her try to escape with Moira Burton amid the outbreak taking place there. Having been the only one to be rescued, she would eventually support Barry Burton in the search for his daughter and in the process participated in the elimination of the last of the Wesker Children. As early as 2014, in the midst of her investigation into bioterrorist activities taking place in the Sonido de Tortuga Island region, Claire was eventually involved in the outbreak that occurred at the site.",

Tsukune becomes a member of the school’s Newspaper Club and eventually befriends several monster girls, including Kurumu Kurono, Yukari Sendo, Ruby Tojo, and Mizore Shirayuki—all of whom become obsessed with him—as well as Kokoa Shuzen, Moka’s younger half-sister. He also makes friends with several male monsters such as Ginei Morioka, Hokuto Kaneshiro, Fang-Fang Huang, and Haiji Miyamoto. They support Tsukune’s belief that monsters and humans can coexist and be more than just enemies, their friendship with him being a prime example of that sentiment.",

Nevertheless, the freed slave, now known as Hohenheim, strongly condemned the gift of immortality that cost countless lives. Since then, Hohenheim has turned bitterly against Homunculus, sworn to end his agonizing immortality, and set free all the souls trapped within their bodies.

I just couldn't ever forgive those who acted as if that value didn't exist. Sukuna... I loathe you. Humans aren't tools. We aren't born with any set role. Which is to say... I don't know. I don't know whether humans are fundamentally good or evil. I could very well be doing the wrong thing here. So I thought I should at least let you see the humanity of someone other than yourself.

In battle, her Semblance allows her to create a shadow of herself, an empty copy that distracts or takes hits from enemies for her while she moves in a different direction. Blake has a quiet nature and a love for books. She is a Faunus (a humanoid race with animal-like features) and a former member of the White Fang, a social rights advocacy group turned extremist paramilitary organization. However, she left in disgust of their violence and joined Beacon Academy to become a Huntress. Blake keeps her Faunus identity a secret by concealing her cat ears because she feels that she is not ready for the attention it would give her if the secret got out and doesn't want to face the discrimination other Faunus receive from humanity.",

Her brother soon learned of her situation and rescued her. In 2005, Claire confronted the t-Virus again when she arrived at Harvardville Airport to meet some friends. While surviving in the airport, she was reunited with Leon, now a U.S. Government agent, who had been sent to deal with the outbreak. Later, in 2011, Claire would be kidnapped along with other TerraSave members by Alex Wesker's organization and left on Sushestvovanie Island, which made her try to escape with Moira Burton amid the outbreak taking place there. Having been the only one to be rescued, she would eventually support Barry Burton in the search for his daughter and in the process participated in the elimination of the last of the Wesker Children. As early as 2014, in the midst of her investigation into bioterrorist activities taking place in the Sonido de Tortuga Island region, Claire was eventually involved in the outbreak that occurred at the site.",

Ilia grew up in Mantle, though her parents, who worked in the mines, wanted something better for their daughter. Thus, they enrolled her in an Atlas program and told her to disguise her Faunus heritage so she would fit in with the higher society. Managing to actually make some friends and blend in quite well, everything was going well until reports came in that the mines had suffered a cave-in which resulted in the deaths of her parents. Her friends simply laughed at the news, causing Ilia to uncontrollably change color and reveal her secret. Suddenly her so-called friends were afraid of her, and she assaulted them in retaliation.",

As Führer, Bradley is the respected Commander-in-Chief of the State Military, even though his political standpoints are often questioned in certain instances such as the Ishval Civil War, which was only one of many insurrections focused on creating a massive Philosopher's Stone for Father.",

Marrow is described as mischievous in personality, having been kicked out of an undisclosed place at least three times in the past. As the novice member of the Ace-Ops, he is also the most naive and childish of the group, having to be 'babysat' by Harriet Bree. A large aspect of Marrow's motivation to have become a Huntsman in the past was that many said he couldn't. However, beating those odds, Marrow was able to rise to the top of the ranks, becoming an Ace-Op.",

He trained alongside his friendly rival Ken under their mutual master Gouken and was the victor of the first Street Fighter tournament. His encounter with his master's nemesis Akuma during the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series awoke the untapped Satsui no Hadou or \"murderous intent\" within him although this power was eventually overwhelmed in Street Fighter V, when he mastered the Power of Nothingness, a source of higher power arising from a state of consciousness in which the mind is free from thoughts and emotions. In Street Fighter III, he continues to travel the world in search of strong opponents.",

However, none of the other Decepticons would trust him, and he confided in Create-A-Bot a great number of secrets, including the location of the AllSpark and the identity of the lost Decepticon they were retrieving: Megatron. Starscream reasoned that he hid these things because revealing them would lead to a power struggle, but no one bought it except the naive rookie.",

Its goal is the absorption of the World of Trophy into Subspace, done by the usage of Subspace Bombs. As Tabuu cannot leave Subspace, most of the forces are located in the World of Trophy while Tabuu manipulates them from Subspace. Those include the Isle of the Ancients, the Halberd (Piloted by Mr. Game & Watch) and the Koopa Troop. Most relations within the army are quite fragile, however, as a lot of them are done either through force or trickery. Notably, almost no one knows the existence of Tabuu, as the latter hides behind Master Hand to communicate his orders to his commanders.",

In his first appearance, Sun is shown to be fun-loving and mischievous, with little regard for the law - stowing away on a ship, thanking the crew for the ride during his escape, throwing a banana peel in a detective's face, and stealing apples. He has a lot of self-confidence, referring to himself as a \"great stowaway\". He is also a bit of a flirt towards Blake. In conversation, Sun is very laid-back and casual. He is also kind and patient, willing to listen to Blake's story and waiting for her to do so for nearly two days, bearing with her \"small talk and weird looks\". He is not afraid to give his opinion and has a dislike for those who regard themselves as \"holier than thou\", or who \"use force to get whatever they want\", such as the White Fang. Sun also seems to be willing to help others, regardless of whether he is asked or not, even if he barely knows them. This quality is further demonstrated when he readily volunteers to help Team RWBY with their investigation, despite both Blake and Ruby stating their opposition to his involvement.",

He's the son of Yasopp, a sharpshooter serving under Shanks, and comes from the East Blue. Usopp had a reputation on his home island of being a serial liar who claimed that pirates were attacking, which came back to haunt him when real pirates actually attacked. He's a rather boastful seventeen/nineteen-year-old who likes to tell tall tales (several of which actually do come true, after a fashion), though he's more prone to hiding behind the stronger crew members such as Zoro when he actually gets into a fight. However, when push comes to shove, he is very dependable. He specializes in the use of a slingshot, called the Galaxy Slingshot (Ginga Pachinko), which he replaced with the Kabuto and later the Black Kabuto. This slingshot, coupled with his talent in tricking enemies, and his absurd sniping skills, make him a redoubtable sniper able to intervene at a very long range.",

    "Summary": "Winter Schnee is a character in RWBY and the elder sister of Weiss Schnee. Despite being the eldest child, Winter's right to inherit the Schnee Dust Company was abdicated upon her decision to join the Atlas Military. At first glance, Winter appears to be cold, dignified, and distant, preferring to keep her emotions subdued and speaking in a very high-class, eloquent, almost robotic fashion. However, when interacting with Weiss, she smiles and shows that she cares about her younger sister's life and well-being. Although she strives to keep her emotions in check, she can be rather hot-headed at times. Once she becomes angry, she drops her dignified ladylike demeanor and loses all restraint. Winter consistently wrestles with her emotions, never letting them overpower her, yet still allowing them to guide her on what she believes to be a righteous path.",

    "Summary": "Even as the prince of the Fire Nation, Zuko has always struggled in life, particularly in matching his prodigy sister Azula and getting his father's acknowledgment. This came to a head when Ozai punished him for a perceived slight by horrifically burning his face and sending him into exile, refusing to let him return until he had captured the Avatar. (This was intended to be an impossible task, since Aang had been missing for a century). Determined to prove his worth to his father, Zuko hunted Aang across the world for the first season while trying to find his own destiny. Eventually, Zuko betrays Iroh and helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se. Granted amnesty for his actions, Zuko is finally allowed to come home. He has his honor restored, the adoration of a nation, the love of his life, and the respect of his father. And he finds himself lacking. After some soul-searching, Zuko finally realizes what Iroh had always tried to teach him. After calling out Ozai for controlling him, making him feel worthless, burning his face, banishing him for three years and generally being an evil, contemptible douchebag, Zuko defects to join the Gaang as Aang's Firebending teacher. Though initially mistrusted, grudges dissolve into friendships and Zuko soon becomes a core member of the group. At the end of the series, Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and strives to rebuild the world into an era of peace. And hopefully find his mother.",

    "Summary": "Claire Redfield is a current member of the human rights organization, TerraSave. She is the younger sister of BSAA operative and former S.T.A.R.S. member Chris Redfield. Claire is a survivor of the Raccoon City Incident, which took place in September 1998 after she traveled to the city in search of her brother. After escaping the city with the help of Leon S. Kennedy, Claire ventured to Europe to resume her search for Chris. In December, she was captured by Umbrella after infiltrating their Paris Laboratory and transported to the Umbrella owned Rockfort Island and imprisoned. When Rockfort Island was attacked by a mysterious Special Forces group, Claire tried to escape with a fellow prisoner, Steve Burnside, leading to both of their involvements in the Antarctic outbreak. Her brother soon learned of her situation and rescued her. In 2005, Claire confronted the t-Virus again when she arrived at Harvardville Airport to meet some friends. While surviving in the airport, she was reunited with Leon, now a U.S. Government agent, who had been sent to deal with the outbreak. Later, in 2011, Claire would be kidnapped along with other TerraSave members by Alex Wesker's organization and left on Sushestvovanie Island, which made her try to escape with Moira Burton amid the outbreak taking place there. Having been the only one to be rescued, she would eventually support Barry Burton in the search for his daughter and in the process participated in the elimination of the last of the Wesker Children. As early as 2014, in the midst of her investigation into bioterrorist activities taking place in the Sonido de Tortuga Island region, Claire was eventually involved in the outbreak that occurred at the site.",
