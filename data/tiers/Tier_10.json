    "Summary": "Mitchell Mayo, once an average guy went inexplicably crazy and donned the identity of the Condiment King to cause crime. He was shown tormenting multiple policemen with his special designed sauce, until he was swiftly defeated by Batgirl and Robin. He was then taken to Arkham Asylum, where he eventually was able to work in the kitchen and fuel his obsession, as well as improve upon his formula. This was further aided by Poison Ivy, who taught him vast knowledge on roots, herbs, and spices. Years later, he would get out of Arkham and be \"jokerized\". Jokerization is stated to amplify the infected's personality, which actually made Mitchell a credible threat. This would almost cause the Birds of Prey to lose to him, as they though he was a joke. It is later stated due to the nature of Condiment King's obsession/portrayal as a joke, juries and parole boards don't take him seriously, thus allowing him to be set free on Gotham again and again. During Final Crisis Aftermath, Mitchell was one of Immortus' followers, The Army of the Endangered, and was cybernetically enhanced by the brilliant Professor Achilles Milo. He was the one to introduce the \"Human Flame\" to the group, which would be a mistake. Human Flame would rebel, and along with Seductress, kill every member of The Army of the Endangered, including Mitchell.",

Following his refusal, his Arizona home was blown up, killing his parents and sister, but Amadeus escaped, arriving in Jackalope, New Mexico the following morning. Contacting Sexton, he dismissed her claim that a second agency was responsible. Adopting an orphaned coyote pup, Amadeus confronted a helicopter sent by his enemies, deflecting the aim of one of the attacker’s gun to distract another attacker, whose misfired missile, whether by accident or design, struck bystander Bruce Banner, triggering his transformation into the Hulk. The Hulk quickly disabled the helicopter and took Amadeus and the pup to safety before departing, earning the boy’s undying devotion.",

At first he tried to hide his vast powers, believing he would be shunned as a freak of nature, but the urge to use them was too great to resist, and soon Hall used his abilities openly.

While mostly suited to a marine environment, many later species also inhabited freshwater environments. It is thought to have had lobed toes similar to loons and grebes, but may have also had webbed toes. It is thought its anatomical structure meant it would belly-slide similar to seals,[1] but may also have been able to stand upright similar to cormorants.[2]",

Reece became a lowly laboratory technician working at a nuclear plant owned by the Acme Atomics Corporation. He was disgruntled by his job's long hours and low pay. One day, Reece accidentally activated an experimental particle generator, which bombarded him with an unknown form of radiation. The explosion horribly disfigured his face with scars in the shape of lightning bolts, but it also had a mutagenic effect on Reece, releasing his potential for psionic powers on a cosmic scale. Reece could now control all matter, even down to the molecular level, and all energy, and he now used his immense powers to take out his pent-up frustrations on the world under the moniker of Molecule Man.",

Despite its superficial resemblance to big cats, it is not a feline, nor is it a carnivoran either; instead, it was an oxyaenid, a group of carnivorous mammals that were apex predators during the Eocene. Unlike carnivorans, it had stiffened vertebrae similar to armadillos or pangolins, thought to be a tradeoff of flexibility for larger size.[1] In life, they would have been terrestrial apex predators adapted for hunting on the forest floor.[2]",

Its name comes from the Latin word pulmonis, which means \"lung,\" and the Greek word skorpios, which means \"scorpion;\"[1] a fitting name considering it possessed book lungs on its underside similar to modern scorpions, which indicated it was terrestrial. As it was not adapted to burrowing like later scorpions, it was likely a diurnal hunter with an active lifestyle.",

Paraponera is predatory, and like all primitive poneromorphs, does not display polymorphism in the worker caste; the queen ant is not much larger than the workers. They are not aggressive ants but are vicious when defending the nest, when they produce a stridulating sound and sting with ferocity.",

It lived in rivers 415–398 million years ago, during the early Devonian. With eyes on the top of its head and a mouth on its underside, it was a bottom feeder much like a Plecostomus or catfish, straining food into its jawless mouth. It would have likely fed on worms and crustaceans in the mud, along with feeding on detritus.",

Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

Its name comes from its \"bizarre and dream-like appearance,\" with the various unusual and perplexing characteristics it had. When first discovered, it was thought to be an annelid, but was later identified as a lobopodian.[1] It has been found throughout Canada and China, along with fragments of spine elsewhere throughout Burgess shale-type deposits.[2] It lived during the middle Cambrian, leading a benthic lifestyle in deeper parts of the oceans.",

Most of the identified species have been found in North America, notably in what was once covered by the Western Interior Seaway such as Kansas and Canada, while one species has been discovered near Russia. While mostly suited to a marine environment, many later species also inhabited freshwater environments. It is thought to have had lobed toes similar to loons and grebes, but may have also had webbed toes. It is thought its anatomical structure meant it would belly-slide similar to seals,[1] but may also have been able to stand upright similar to cormorants.[2]",

It is thought its ancestors found their way to this island during the Messinian Salinity Crisis, which connected the island to mainland Europe, before the island was isolated once more by the Zanclean Flood. It is thought to have gone extinct when sea levels dropped around the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary, connecting Menorca with the island of Mallorca and allowing other mammals to cross over, which outcompeted it.[2]",

These creatures first emerged around 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago, during the early Pleistocene.[1] Around 3,200 years ago, the Thylacine population on mainland Australia would have died off, the major causes thought to be human activity and the introduction of dingoes.[2] Populations would remain prevalent on the island of Tasmania up until the early 20th century, before extermination by farmers and bounty hunters, along with habitat loss, competition from wild dogs, and disease would devastate them (with possibly already low genetic diversity worsening their chances of survival).[3] The last Thylacine was captured and kept in Hobart Zoo until he died on September 7, 1936.",

Following his refusal, his Arizona home was blown up, killing his parents and sister, but Amadeus escaped, arriving in Jackalope, New Mexico the following morning. Contacting Sexton, he dismissed her claim that a second agency was responsible. Adopting an orphaned coyote pup, Amadeus confronted a helicopter sent by his enemies, deflecting the aim of one of the attacker’s gun to distract another attacker, whose misfired missile, whether by accident or design, struck bystander Bruce Banner, triggering his transformation into the Hulk. The Hulk quickly disabled the helicopter and took Amadeus and the pup to safety before departing, earning the boy’s undying devotion.",

It lived in rivers 415–398 million years ago, during the early Devonian. With eyes on the top of its head and a mouth on its underside, it was a bottom feeder much like a Plecostomus or catfish, straining food into its jawless mouth. It would have likely fed on worms and crustaceans in the mud, along with feeding on detritus.",

    "Summary": "Mitchell Mayo, once an average guy went inexplicably crazy and donned the identity of the Condiment King to cause crime. He was shown tormenting multiple policemen with his special designed sauce, until he was swiftly defeated by Batgirl and Robin. He was then taken to Arkham Asylum, where he eventually was able to work in the kitchen and fuel his obsession, as well as improve upon his formula. This was further aided by Poison Ivy, who taught him vast knowledge on roots, herbs, and spices. Years later, he would get out of Arkham and be \"jokerized\". Jokerization is stated to amplify the infected's personality, which actually made Mitchell a credible threat. This would almost cause the Birds of Prey to lose to him, as they though he was a joke. It is later stated due to the nature of Condiment King's obsession/portrayal as a joke, juries and parole boards don't take him seriously, thus allowing him to be set free on Gotham again and again. During Final Crisis Aftermath, Mitchell was one of Immortus' followers, The Army of the Endangered, and was cybernetically enhanced by the brilliant Professor Achilles Milo. He was the one to introduce the \"Human Flame\" to the group, which would be a mistake. Human Flame would rebel, and along with Seductress, kill every member of The Army of the Endangered, including Mitchell.",

It is believed that eating as little as half a mushroom is enough to kill a healthy adult. It has been involved in the majority of deaths from mushroom poisoning and may have been the couse of death of Roman Emperor Claudius in 54 AD. Its primary toxic constituent is α-amanitin, which causes damage to the liver and kidneys and leads to hepatic and renal failure that can be fatal.",

A number of ideas have been postulated as to the purpose of the \"horns\" along the back and sides of its head, such as supporting skin flaps or gills, counterbalance, or possibly defense. The most recent theory is that it provided lift and reduced drag while swimming.[1] This amphibian lived in freshwater environments around 306-255 million years ago from the late carboniferous to late Permian.",

Recovering from the accident, Hall discovered that he could mentally control gravity. At first he tried to hide his vast powers, believing he would be shunned as a freak of nature, but the urge to use them was too great to resist, and soon Hall used his abilities openly. To his pleasure, people began to fear him, and he started to take whatever and whomever he desired.",

Extremely vicious, enormously destructive, ferociously violent, and horribly brutal, it has a very aggressive nature. Although rarely seen in the wild, once it appears it goes on a rampage. When this happens, it doesn't calm until it has burned everything down and razed the fields and mountains around it. Not even harsh storms are able to stop its rage, and there are records of this Pokémon's rampages lasting a whole month. A single Gyarados has enough destructive power to totally annihilate even a major city. Gyarados is attracted to violence and tends to appear when there is a world conflict or war. When humans begin to fight, it will appear and burn everything to the ground with intensely hot flames. During past wars Gyarados would appear and leave blazing ruins in its wake, and in ancient literature there is a record of a Gyarados that razed a village when violence flared. When Magikarp evolves into Gyarados, its brain cells undergo a structural transformation. It is said that this transformation is to blame for this Pokémon's wildly violent nature.",

When first discovered, it was thought to be an annelid, but was later identified as a lobopodian.[1] It has been found throughout Canada and China, along with fragments of spine elsewhere throughout Burgess shale-type deposits.[2] It lived during the middle Cambrian, leading a benthic lifestyle in deeper parts of the oceans.",

While mostly suited to a marine environment, many later species also inhabited freshwater environments. It is thought to have had lobed toes similar to loons and grebes, but may have also had webbed toes.

Many species grow very large – in Laos, male giant huntsman spiders (Heteropoda maxima) attain a legspan of 25–30 centimetres. Persons unfamiliar with spider taxonomy commonly confuse large species with tarantulas, but huntsman spiders can generally be identified by their legs, which, rather than being jointed vertically relative to the body, are twisted in such a way that in some attitudes the legs extend forward in a crab-like fashion.",

When threatened or when hunting, the inland taipan is able to strike rapidly and accurately.[2] When defending itself, will curl into an S-shape to threaten a would be attacker, and strike if the threat does not heed this warning.[2]",

It dwelled in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes and ponds,[1] along with some hypersaline environments,[2] with the pachyostosis helping it maintain Neutral Buoyancy, while the structure of its ribs likely helped it to dive.[1] Along with these adaptations, it is evidenced to give birth to live young.[3]",

An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the biggest cat in North America, and the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas.",

It is nicknamed the Tasmania wolf due to its canine like features that arose from convergent evolution; the Tasmanian tiger nickname comes from its striped appearance. These creatures first emerged around 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago, during the early Pleistocene.[1] Around 3,200 years ago, the Thylacine population on mainland Australia would have died off, the major causes thought to be human activity and the introduction of dingoes.[2] Populations would remain prevalent on the island of Tasmania up until the early 20th century, before extermination by farmers and bounty hunters, along with habitat loss, competition from wild dogs, and disease would devastate them (with possibly already low genetic diversity worsening their chances of survival).[3] The last Thylacine was captured and kept in Hobart Zoo until he died on September 7, 1936.",

In order to free her, Hsien-Ko and Mei-Ling unleashed a forbidden ritual which turned them both into supernatural creatures and allowed them to hunt the Darkstalkers as Darkhunters. Hsien-Ko gained incredible strength and special powers, though with the risk of falling victim of her savage new nature. Mei-Ling then developed the ability to transform into a talisman and place herself on her sister's forehead, preventing her from losing control.",

Insect-like aliens resembling gigantic upright cockroaches, the Nebulans hail from an unnamed homeworld located within the M Space Hunter Nebula. Having evolved into the dominant lifeforms on their planet following the extinction of a human-like species that existed before them, the Nebulans were forced to seek out a new home planet as the lasting pollution left behind by their predecessors rendered their world uninhabitable. The Nebulans discovered Earth, a planet similar to their own inhabited by a species much like their predecessors who were in the process of destroying the planet through industrial pollution. Planning to save the Earth from humanity and establish a new peaceful utopia for their kind, a Nebulan invasion force posed as a charitable organization constructing the World Children's Land theme park, using the park's Godzilla Tower attraction as a staging ground for their invasion. The Nebulans summoned their own cybernetic monster creation, Gigan, along with the dreaded King Ghidorah to eradicate human civilization. A group of humans who were privy to the conspiracy foiled the Nebulans and destroyed their base of operations, while Godzilla and Anguirus drove off the space monsters. A year later, the Seatopians, themselves in the process of launching an invasion of the surface world with their own monster Megalon, contacted the Nebulans and asked for Gigan's assistance. The Nebulans obliged and sent Gigan to assist in the invasion, but both he and Megalon were repelled by Godzilla and Jet Jaguar.",

    "Summary": "Envy (エンヴィー Enbī) is the embodiment of some of Father's envy. Envy is genderless, and their resentment of humanity is more heartful and personal than any other homunculus; having caused the Ishvalan war by shooting a child in the head while in the guise of an Amestrian officer. While Envy typically appears as an androgynous humanoid, their \"real form\" is a giant, animalistic beast, and their original form before being turned into a Homunculus was a tiny, leech-like bug.",

Homunculus taught the slave, whom he'd named Van Hohenheim, about a mysterious science known as Alchemy, which he used to elevate his social standing until he became the servant of the king of Xerxes himself. Dying of old age, the king latched onto Homunculus' promises of immortality, and helped him set up a country-wide transmutation circle, being told that it would bring him eternal life by draining the souls of the entire country within him. However, Homunculus had set up the circle in such a way that the souls would flow into him and Hohenheim instead, killing the king and destroying Xerxes in one night.",

Dying of old age, the king latched onto Homunculus' promises of immortality, and helped him set up a country-wide transmutation circle, being told that it would bring him eternal life by draining the souls of the entire country within him. However, Homunculus had set up the circle in such a way that the souls would flow into him and Hohenheim instead, killing the king and destroying Xerxes in one night.",

    "Summary": "The M Space Hunter Nebula Aliens (Ｍ宇宙ハンター星雲人), also known as the Nebulans, are an alien species who first appeared in the 1972 Godzilla film Godzilla vs. Gigan. Insect-like aliens resembling gigantic upright cockroaches, the Nebulans hail from an unnamed homeworld located within the M Space Hunter Nebula. Having evolved into the dominant lifeforms on their planet following the extinction of a human-like species that existed before them, the Nebulans were forced to seek out a new home planet as the lasting pollution left behind by their predecessors rendered their world uninhabitable. The Nebulans discovered Earth, a planet similar to their own inhabited by a species much like their predecessors who were in the process of destroying the planet through industrial pollution. Planning to save the Earth from humanity and establish a new peaceful utopia for their kind, a Nebulan invasion force posed as a charitable organization constructing the World Children's Land theme park, using the park's Godzilla Tower attraction as a staging ground for their invasion. The Nebulans summoned their own cybernetic monster creation, Gigan, along with the dreaded King Ghidorah to eradicate human civilization. A group of humans who were privy to the conspiracy foiled the Nebulans and destroyed their base of operations, while Godzilla and Anguirus drove off the space monsters. A year later, the Seatopians, themselves in the process of launching an invasion of the surface world with their own monster Megalon, contacted the Nebulans and asked for Gigan's assistance. The Nebulans obliged and sent Gigan to assist in the invasion, but both he and Megalon were repelled by Godzilla and Jet Jaguar.",
