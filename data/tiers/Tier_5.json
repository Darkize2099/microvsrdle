Once a materialistic and greedy neurosurgeon, Strange's medical career was left in pieces after a debilitating car accident which severely damaged the nerves of his hands and made him unable to ever conduct an operation again.

He tearfully declared that Mages would need to be protected and united, thus forming Magia Dragon, the first wizard Guild in the history of Earth Land. At some point in his life, Elefseria taught himself Dragon Slayer Magic in order to combat the Five Dragon Gods. As a consequence of overusing his power, however, he ultimately transformed into a dragon, which led to him being known as the Law Dragon. Since then, Elefseria posted a job request for other Guilds to help defeat the Five Dragon Gods that would go unfulfilled for over a century due to its immense difficulty, gaining the designation of a \"100 Years Quest\".",

While they asked each other for their names, she said that her name was just \"Erza.\" Hence, Jellal decided to give her the surname \"Scarlet\" after her scarlet hair so they would never forget it. Eventually, she rebelled against the cult and escaped, but not without losing Jellal, who had been corrupted by Zeref's Dark Arts. She also served as the guild's 7th Guild Master during Makarov's absence in X792.",

    "Summary": "A nova or classical nova is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently \"new\" star, that slowly fades over several weeks or many months. Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flare-up that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. All observed novae involve closely located binary stars (the progenitors) - either a pair of red dwarfs in the process of merging or a star and white dwarf, all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. Luminous red novae share the name and are also cataclysmic variables, but are a different type of event caused by a stellar merger. Also with similar names are the much more energetic supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae.",

    "Summary": "Alta Face is a being that is the source of all Magic Power in Elentear. It is also the origin of all of the Hands that appear in Elentear. The Hands are similarly structured to the Magic Council's Face, wherein they are all extending from the ground in various places but are all connected to the main body Alta Face. Over many years, the Whiteout Village waged war against Alta Face, eventually sealing it underground. Later on, the Hands started appearing all over Elentear and the villagers soon realized that it is a part of the Alta Face and decided to track and cut them off. After several centuries, it was revealed that the Hands harbored no ill intent and despite giving rise to Tsumeakas on occasions, it is still considered a rare occurrence.",

    "Summary": "Mere minutes after achieving the highest score ever on the Excello Soap Company’s “Brain Fight” internet game, earning the title “Mastermind Excello,” 16-year-old Amadeus Cho was approached by a woman called Agent Sexton, representing an unidentified agency wishing to train him. Following his refusal, his Arizona home was blown up, killing his parents and sister, but Amadeus escaped, arriving in Jackalope, New Mexico the following morning. Contacting Sexton, he dismissed her claim that a second agency was responsible. Adopting an orphaned coyote pup, Amadeus confronted a helicopter sent by his enemies, deflecting the aim of one of the attacker’s gun to distract another attacker, whose misfired missile, whether by accident or design, struck bystander Bruce Banner, triggering his transformation into the Hulk. The Hulk quickly disabled the helicopter and took Amadeus and the pup to safety before departing, earning the boy’s undying devotion.",

It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable.

Fighting crime for years, his mask was torn off in a heated battle in 1962, revealing to the world that he was African-American; the President soon afterward awarded him the Medal of Freedom and asked him to retire, current racial tensions spurred to even greater heights by the knowledge of a black super-man. Grudgingly conceding, he continued on adventures to the four corners of the Earth in secret for decades, defending it against numerous super-scientific and mystical threats such as the Technocracy, the Deathwalkers, the Atomic Skeletons of Paris and Doctor Skorpion, before being drawn out of retirement to aid the Avengers against the return of his old friend-turned-enemy Anti-Man. Returned to regular duty, he continues to defend the Earth with distinction, both on his own and in teams such as Luke Cage's Mighty Avengers and the Ultimates.",

The undersheath became directly wired to Tony's brain, which allowed him to control the new Iron Man Armor with thought and even interface with other technologies.",

    "Summary": "\"After Odin, All-father of the Norse pantheon, slew the evil frost giants, he discovered they hid a human-sized baby in their midst. Odin took the child back with him to the gods' home of Asgard and adopted him, under the name of Loki. The boy grew into a skilled sorcerer, shape-shifter, and one of Asgard's staunchest defenders, often deploying his magics alongside the might of his foster brother Thor. But the mercurial God of Mischief could hinder the Asgardians, as much as help them, as when he tricked the blind god Hoder into slaying the otherwise invulnerable Balder with an enchanted spear made of mistletoe. And so the gods never fully trusted Loki. Yet in his selfish narcissism, he convinced himself it was Thor who stole his glory from him. If the thunder god fell, or so he thought, the love, and crown, of Asgard would be his. Thor's departure from Asgard to become guardian of Earth gave the god of mischief the perfect opportunity to slay him out of their father's sight. His repeated attacks on the thunder gods, and the mystical empowerment of Thor's enemies, have made Loki one of the greatest threats to our world as well as Asgard!\" - Origins of Siege: Loki by Fred van Lente",

    "Summary": "Odin (oh-din) has one eye that blazes like the sun, having lost his other eye in payment for a drink from the well of Mimir. He once stole the mead of poetry, and some myths say he grants poetic ability and inspiration to mortals. Odin hung himself on Yggdrasil for nine days, pierced by his own spear, until by virtue of his suggering he was able to reach down and seize magical runes that were the source of wisdom and magical Lore. His suffering so impressed the son of the giant Bolthor that he taught Odin nine magical songs that allowed him to master eighteen magical spells previously unknown to any man or woman. Odin is fated to be swallowed by Loki's son Fenrir at Ragnarok, but his own son Vidar will avenge him. Wearing a dark, wide-brimmed hat that casts a shadow over his face, Odin travels as a mortal wanderer. As a god of magic, war, and wisdom, he visits Midgard to distribute knowledge and victory in battle. His many titles hint at his various roles.",

During the ancient times, he was worshiped as the god of wisdom by the inhabitants of Earth. Once the greatest warrior in all the Nine Realms, over the centuries he learned how to appreciate peace, eventually banishing his own daughter to Hel when she attempted to subjugate the entire universe. When Thor almost provoked a war with the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, Odin stripped him of his powers and exiled him to Earth, leaving Loki to take the throne when Odin fell into the Odinsleep. When Thor returned and saved the Frost Giants from extinction at the hands of Loki, who seemingly lost his life during the conflict, Odin realized that Thor had proven that he would be worthy enough to take the throne of Asgard one day.",

That's the secret of the universe, you know. Billions of people, making billions of choices, creating infinite Earths. Some so similar to each other you could spend a lifetime searching for any distinction, others so radically different they defy comprehension. [...] Every version of reality balances precariously on this singular Earth. It seems so different from the Earths we know. I can't imagine what series of decisions led to this world hurtling out of its orbit. But I know this, the source of the cataclysm was the same as it always is - man. [...] You know better. Man is a cancer and I've chosen to cut out the disease. [...] Everyone who ever lived, who ever will live. I choose to make the only possible real choice.",

Later, Thor killed Surtur and claimed his crown, believing he had prevented Ragnarök. When Thor came to reclaim the throne from Hela, he was overpowered. Thor decided to actualize Ragnarök and use Surtur's power to defeat and kill Hela. After the Asgardians were out of harm's way, Loki resurrected Surtur, who erupted from Asgard moments later. Surtur destroyed Asgard, and killed Hela and himself in the process.",

His savagery while serving in the US black-ops earned him the nickname Erik Killmonger.

Manipulating and then killing Ulysses Klaue to gain access to their city, Killmonger seemingly killed T'Challa during ritual combat and took the throne, but just before Killmonger unleashed his plan, the Black Panther had returned and challenged Killmonger, eventually killing him in their final battle.",

A comforting thought, I imagine, for those seeking redemption, but, I tell you, put such thoughts from your mind. You need only peer into a demon’s eyes to know evil is not some vacuum waiting for virtue to come and fill its emptiness. Evil is a force. It is an influence in the cosmos, an agency equal to or perhaps even greater than its antithesis. There are two sides in this eternal struggle, one light and the other dark. You might find evil’s works reprehensible, yet to those whose hearts belong to corruption, good deeds are equally deplorable. Understand, there is no redemption, only treason against the side you were born to serve.",

Fighting crime for years, his mask was torn off in a heated battle in 1962, revealing to the world that he was African-American; the President soon afterward awarded him the Medal of Freedom and asked him to retire, current racial tensions spurred to even greater heights by the knowledge of a black super-man. Grudgingly conceding, he continued on adventures to the four corners of the Earth in secret for decades, defending it against numerous super-scientific and mystical threats such as the Technocracy, the Deathwalkers, the Atomic Skeletons of Paris and Doctor Skorpion, before being drawn out of retirement to aid the Avengers against the return of his old friend-turned-enemy Anti-Man. Returned to regular duty, he continues to defend the Earth with distinction, both on his own and in teams such as Luke Cage's Mighty Avengers and the Ultimates.",

    "Summary": "Erik Stevens (born N'Jadaka) was a former American black-ops soldier of Wakandan origin through his father, Prince N'Jobu. His savagery while serving in the US black-ops earned him the nickname Erik Killmonger. Years after T'Chaka killed his father for betraying Wakanda, Killmonger then planned to forcibly dethrone T'Challa in order to accomplish his father's plan to use Wakanda's technology to conquer the world via imperialistic, supremacist, world-spanning, and likely genocidal warfare, to stop what he perceived to be the oppression of people of African descent by the world. Manipulating and then killing Ulysses Klaue to gain access to their city, Killmonger seemingly killed T'Challa during ritual combat and took the throne, but just before Killmonger unleashed his plan, the Black Panther had returned and challenged Killmonger, eventually killing him in their final battle.",

Despite her intimidating exterior, she deeply cares for her comrades and treats them as if they were family, as she lost her own after her hometown was ransacked by fanatical worshippers of the Dark Mage Zeref and was forced to build the Tower of Heaven. She was imprisoned together with several other slaves, most of which were children. Among these children were Jellal Fernandes, Shô, Simon, Wally Buchanan, and Millianna. While they asked each other for their names, she said that her name was just \"Erza.\" Hence, Jellal decided to give her the surname \"Scarlet\" after her scarlet hair so they would never forget it. Eventually, she rebelled against the cult and escaped, but not without losing Jellal, who had been corrupted by Zeref's Dark Arts. She also served as the guild's 7th Guild Master during Makarov's absence in X792.",

Gaining her power from Asgard, Hela planned to rule Asgard and create an Asgardian Empire.

    "Summary": "Model 29, known as Extremis Armor. In an attempt to stop the Extremis-powered terrorist Mallen, Tony Stark was fatally injured by the criminal. Seeing no other option, Tony convinced Extremis co-developer Maya Hansen to inject him a dose of Extremis to heal his injuries. Additionally, Stark had been working on an experimental Iron Man Armor that was tougher and lighter than his then-current unit. However, he couldn't miniaturize the suit's control systems and other vital elements. In order to overcome this obstacle, the Extremis dose was modified so that the crucial undersheath of the Iron Man suit was supercompressed and stored in the hollows of Tony's bones. The undersheath became directly wired to Tony's brain, which allowed him to control the new Iron Man Armor with thought and even interface with other technologies.",

Odin took the child back with him to the gods' home of Asgard and adopted him, under the name of Loki. The boy grew into a skilled sorcerer, shape-shifter, and one of Asgard's staunchest defenders, often deploying his magics alongside the might of his foster brother Thor. But the mercurial God of Mischief could hinder the Asgardians, as much as help them, as when he tricked the blind god Hoder into slaying the otherwise invulnerable Balder with an enchanted spear made of mistletoe. And so the gods never fully trusted Loki. Yet in his selfish narcissism, he convinced himself it was Thor who stole his glory from him. If the thunder god fell, or so he thought, the love, and crown, of Asgard would be his. Thor's departure from Asgard to become guardian of Earth gave the god of mischief the perfect opportunity to slay him out of their father's sight. His repeated attacks on the thunder gods, and the mystical empowerment of Thor's enemies, have made Loki one of the greatest threats to our world as well as Asgard!\" - Origins of Siege: Loki by Fred van Lente",

He once stole the mead of poetry, and some myths say he grants poetic ability and inspiration to mortals. Odin hung himself on Yggdrasil for nine days, pierced by his own spear, until by virtue of his suggering he was able to reach down and seize magical runes that were the source of wisdom and magical Lore. His suffering so impressed the son of the giant Bolthor that he taught Odin nine magical songs that allowed him to master eighteen magical spells previously unknown to any man or woman. Odin is fated to be swallowed by Loki's son Fenrir at Ragnarok, but his own son Vidar will avenge him. Wearing a dark, wide-brimmed hat that casts a shadow over his face, Odin travels as a mortal wanderer. As a god of magic, war, and wisdom, he visits Midgard to distribute knowledge and victory in battle. His many titles hint at his various roles.",

Once the greatest warrior in all the Nine Realms, over the centuries he learned how to appreciate peace, eventually banishing his own daughter to Hel when she attempted to subjugate the entire universe. When Thor almost provoked a war with the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, Odin stripped him of his powers and exiled him to Earth, leaving Loki to take the throne when Odin fell into the Odinsleep. When Thor returned and saved the Frost Giants from extinction at the hands of Loki, who seemingly lost his life during the conflict, Odin realized that Thor had proven that he would be worthy enough to take the throne of Asgard one day.",

Fifty thousand years after a starquake occurred on the surface of SGR 1806-20, the radiation from the resultant explosion reached Earth on December 27, 2004 (GRB 041227). In terms of gamma rays, the burst had an absolute magnitude around −29. It was the brightest event known to have been sighted on this planet from an origin outside the Solar System. A similar blast within 3 parsecs (10 light years) of Earth would destroy the ozone layer and would be similar in effect to a 12-kiloton nuclear blast from an altitude of 7.5 kilometers across every square kilometer of Earth's surface exposed to the blast, easily triggering an abrupt mass extinction.",

Such as the renown of this battle that they gained the nicknames Two-Faced Goddess or Sisters-Who-Were-One. At their creation they brought into being the goddess Chauntea, and the three goddesses, representing light, dark, and matter, blessed the voids with life and order. Ultimately, this led to their conflict- Shar desired life to remain cold and filled with suffering, eventually returning to nothingness. Thus the battle began.",

Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flare-up that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. All observed novae involve closely located binary stars (the progenitors) - either a pair of red dwarfs in the process of merging or a star and white dwarf, all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. Luminous red novae share the name and are also cataclysmic variables, but are a different type of event caused by a stellar merger. Also with similar names are the much more energetic supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae.",

For countless millennia, it was foretold that Ragnarök, the destruction of Asgard, is destined to take place when the fire demon Surtur consumes the realm. In an attempt to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled, Odin confined Surtur to Muspelheim and locked the Eternal Flame in a vault beneath his palace. Later, Thor killed Surtur and claimed his crown, believing he had prevented Ragnarök. When Thor came to reclaim the throne from Hela, he was overpowered. Thor decided to actualize Ragnarök and use Surtur's power to defeat and kill Hela. After the Asgardians were out of harm's way, Loki resurrected Surtur, who erupted from Asgard moments later. Surtur destroyed Asgard, and killed Hela and himself in the process.",

Fifty thousand years after a starquake occurred on the surface of SGR 1806-20, the radiation from the resultant explosion reached Earth on December 27, 2004 (GRB 041227). In terms of gamma rays, the burst had an absolute magnitude around −29. It was the brightest event known to have been sighted on this planet from an origin outside the Solar System. A similar blast within 3 parsecs (10 light years) of Earth would destroy the ozone layer and would be similar in effect to a 12-kiloton nuclear blast from an altitude of 7.5 kilometers across every square kilometer of Earth's surface exposed to the blast, easily triggering an abrupt mass extinction.",

    "Summary": "A nova or classical nova is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently \"new\" star, that slowly fades over several weeks or many months. Novae involve an interaction between two stars that cause the flare-up that is perceived as a new entity that is much brighter than the stars involved. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. All observed novae involve closely located binary stars (the progenitors) - either a pair of red dwarfs in the process of merging or a star and white dwarf, all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars. Luminous red novae share the name and are also cataclysmic variables, but are a different type of event caused by a stellar merger. Also with similar names are the much more energetic supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae.",

Enraged, Moori prepared to fire an attack at Dodoria until Frieza (or Dodoria in the anime) fired a blast at Cargo, killing him instantly. Dodoria used Moori’s reaction as a brief window to attack him, eventually snapping his neck before continuing on their journey.",

    "Summary": "I wouldn't characterize being a Prime as a curse. It is more of an... an obligation. A burden. I certainly wouldn't characterize it as a privilege. I am nine billion years old. I have, time and again, watched everyone I care about go from young to old to departed in what feels like the pulse of a spark. I remember them all, or at least I remember the feelings I had for them. Sometimes the memories of when I was young are sharper, more vivid, than the Swindle who sold me a hyper-frame manifold just this morning. Sometimes I feel alone even when I am in a crowd. And yet, I do take pride in the work I do. I have helped to save millions of realities, even entire reality clusters. I know the work I do enables countless beings whom I will never even meet to be forged and live and dream and fall in love and create offspring and produce art and, yes, even to die. Am I melancholy? Perhaps, sometimes. But it is a small price to pay. As ever, I thank you for your interest in my own well-being.",

    "Summary": "Black Shadow was one of the first Decepticons that Megatron selected for a torturous upgrade process that would transform him into a planet-devastating superwarrior. With an infusion of ununtrium rendering him virtually indestructible, Black Shadow became part of a small group known as the \"Warriors Elite\" that also came to include Sixshot and Overlord. At the height of the war, Megatron chose to repurpose the Warriors Elite as \"Phase Sixers\", who would enact the doomsday protocols called for by the sixth and final phase of his new infiltration protocol. Informed of this via teleconference with their leader, Black Shadow and Sixshot were excited to serve the Decepticons in this expanded capacity, but Overlord chafed. Black Shadow's exploits were notorious, and were among the prominent highlights of the Great War Cyclonus recalled when he educated Tailgate on the war's history. The exploits included his single-handedly murdering three billion inhabitants of Rigel IV, a battle with the Wreckers during which he killed three of them and dismembered their leader Hyperion, and his massacre of 3,003 members of the Autobots' 113th Battalion, an encounter that saw him personally best Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.",

    "Summary": "Once, far before the events of the series, he was simply Homunculus, or Dwarf In The Flask, a small entity created by the chief alchemist of the country of Xerxes, from the blood of a nameless slave. Homunculus taught the slave, whom he'd named Van Hohenheim, about a mysterious science known as Alchemy, which he used to elevate his social standing until he became the servant of the king of Xerxes himself. Dying of old age, the king latched onto Homunculus' promises of immortality, and helped him set up a country-wide transmutation circle, being told that it would bring him eternal life by draining the souls of the entire country within him. However, Homunculus had set up the circle in such a way that the souls would flow into him and Hohenheim instead, killing the king and destroying Xerxes in one night.",

Dragon, a revolutionary considered \"The World's Most Dangerous Criminal\"; the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, a powerful Marine Vice-Admiral who had cornered the late Pirate King himself on several occasions; the sworn brother of late \"Fire Fist\" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo; and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. During his battle with Kaidou in Onigashima, Luffy manages to awaken the true potential of his Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, tapping into his Gear 5th, granting his rubber-like body increased physical strength and freedom, limited only by his imagination.",

He was created by Jhiaxus under the direction of Nova Prime, who sought to reproduce Nexus Prime's combination technology without the aid of the lost Enigma of Combination. The Crucible Jhiaxus recruited six volunteers, and granted them the ability to combine. As a twisted take on \"'til all are one\", the combiner was intended to be the ultimate fusion of mind and body: a vast amount of intellect combined with unparalleled strength. Unfortunately, his six lobotomized components were driven into insanity by the merging process, and became monsters. Omega Supreme saw the newly dubbed Monstructor for the uncontrollable abomination he was and took him down, though the clash between the two titans caused the destruction of Nova's capital, the Crystal City. After Nova Prime departed Cybertron in the Ark, Omega locked Monstructor's components in a dimensionally-displaced prison to live out the rest of their horrid existence.",

    "Summary": "Overlord was born on Cybertron's second moon 4.2 million years ago, a rare breed known as a \"Point One Percenter\". After its \"first flash\" killed the hapless miners who discovered it, his spark was taken by the Functionist Council's authenticator Three-of-Twelve. In the days before the Cybertronian civil war, Overlord was both an avid spectator of Megatron's gladiatorial matches and a participant in the bouts, even fighting Megatron himself. Megatron would be the only opponent to ever defeat Overlord, and he did so regularly, giving Overlord a pathological fear of defeat. All the same, Overlord still joined Megatron's Decepticon faction upon its founding, though it was not the loftiness of the Decepticon cause that Megatron espoused which enticed him. Rather, it was the chance to have the glorious excess of the gladiator battles move beyond the arena, to encompass entire worlds. To Overlord, the ends didn't matter overly much when the means themselves were this pleasurable. As a result, his tactics developed a reputation as unsound, and his schemes as nothing more than flights of brutal whimsy. Unlike many other powerful Decepticons, he had no interest in command, only in taking his slaughter to the next stage. Megatron was not convinced, however, believing the image of Overlord as simply interested in killing to be a façade, and began searching for a way to exert greater control over him. Recognizing Overlord's power, Megatron regularly sparred with him, and eventually, three million years ago, selected him to be the fourth candidate for an upgrade process that would transform him into a world-shatteringly powerful superwarrior. Rendered virtually indestructible by an infusion of ununtrium to his endoskeleton, Overlord's first action as a member of the \"Warriors Elite\" was to smash out of his capsule and kill the scientist who oversaw the process, Rossum.",

Despite being the youngest of the previous set of Yonko, it is implied that he is on equal level with the experienced Kaidou, Charlotte Linlin, and even Whitebeard, who was feared as the strongest man in the world. When Shanks was younger, he and Buggy were both apprentice pirates in the Jolly Roger Pirate Crew, the crew of the late Pirate King, Gold Roger, and clashed with Whitebeard's crew several times. They were subordinate to Silvers Rayleigh, the first mate of the crew, and spent their time fighting each other. Both of them attended their captain's public execution, where they parted ways to form their own crews. Sometime afterward he became the rival of Dracule Mihawk. The duels between these two are remembered even by Whitebeard.",

Utterly relentless, totally without mercy, steadfastly unwilling to stop his attack until all that is left of his target is their smoldering remains, he is programmed only to feel hate. That, however, is also Trypticon's downfall—for all he can do is hate. He loathes the Autobots to the extent that he would destroy an entire city just to get at one, but he also hates his fellow Decepticons, and that, in turn, means he is not emotionally committed to their cause, as he sees just as little value in them and what they stand for as he does in anything else. Consequently, though he has accepted what he sees as his fated role as the ultimate Decepticon weapon, the war seems pointless and boring to him. It is a prison… and deep down, as much as he refuses to acknowledge it, the most powerful hatred Trypticon feels is hate for himself, for allowing him to be trapped in it.",

As his epithet implies, he is a cyborg, having rebuilt his own body from iron scraps after he was run over by a sea train. He was formerly a member of a criminal shipbreaking gang called the Franky Family, which operated in the shipbuilders' haven of Water 7. He encountered the Straw Hats when he and the Franky Family brutally beat Usopp and stole a great deal of money from the crew while they were attempting to get their boat fixed on the island. However, his interests subsequently aligned with the Straw Hats' when the secret government organization CP9 kidnapped both him and their crewmate Nico Robin in a bid to construct the ancient superweapon Pluton, which he owned the blueprints to. After escaping the clutches of CP9, Franky decided to join their crew, drawn by their dedication to both their ship and their fellow crewmen.",

He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. During his battle with Kaidou in Onigashima, Luffy manages to awaken the true potential of his Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, tapping into his Gear 5th, granting his rubber-like body increased physical strength and freedom, limited only by his imagination.",

When their plan was exposed by the Earth Defense Force, the Xilien Commander was assassinated and usurped by his subordinate who became the Controller of Planet X. The Controller unleashed all of the Xiliens' mind-controlled kaiju on Earth and tried to eliminate all resistance, but the surviving members of the EDF used the Gotengo to free Godzilla from his prison in Antarctica. Godzilla swiftly eliminated most of the Xiliens' monsters before the Controller summoned his ultimate weapon, Monster X, to stop him. The Gotengo breached the Xilien Mothership and its crew were able to defeat the Controller and his minions. In a final act, the Controller set the Mothership to self-destruct, but the Gotengo was able to escape in time and help Godzilla overcome Monster X's final form, Keizer Ghidorah.",

Among other things, she was introduced by eating some of her own men like snacks. Big Mom has eaten the Soru Soru no Mi, which allows her to take portions of souls out of a person (reducing their lifespan) and redistribute them into inanimate objects and even animals, granting them sentience and/or anthropomorphism.",

With an infusion of ununtrium rendering him virtually indestructible, Black Shadow became part of a small group known as the \"Warriors Elite\" that also came to include Sixshot and Overlord. At the height of the war, Megatron chose to repurpose the Warriors Elite as \"Phase Sixers\", who would enact the doomsday protocols called for by the sixth and final phase of his new infiltration protocol. Informed of this via teleconference with their leader, Black Shadow and Sixshot were excited to serve the Decepticons in this expanded capacity, but Overlord chafed. Black Shadow's exploits were notorious, and were among the prominent highlights of the Great War Cyclonus recalled when he educated Tailgate on the war's history. The exploits included his single-handedly murdering three billion inhabitants of Rigel IV, a battle with the Wreckers during which he killed three of them and dismembered their leader Hyperion, and his massacre of 3,003 members of the Autobots' 113th Battalion, an encounter that saw him personally best Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus.",

Should Kirby collect all former 72 Crystal Shards before facing Miracle Matter, however, this would force 0² to reveal itself, acting as the true final boss.",

Dragon, a revolutionary considered \"The World's Most Dangerous Criminal\"; the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, a powerful Marine Vice-Admiral who had cornered the late Pirate King himself on several occasions; the sworn brother of late \"Fire Fist\" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo; and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. During his battle with Kaidou in Onigashima, Luffy manages to awaken the true potential of his Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, tapping into his Gear 5th, granting his rubber-like body increased physical strength and freedom, limited only by his imagination.",

He was created by Jhiaxus under the direction of Nova Prime, who sought to reproduce Nexus Prime's combination technology without the aid of the lost Enigma of Combination. The Crucible Jhiaxus recruited six volunteers, and granted them the ability to combine. As a twisted take on \"'til all are one\", the combiner was intended to be the ultimate fusion of mind and body: a vast amount of intellect combined with unparalleled strength. Unfortunately, his six lobotomized components were driven into insanity by the merging process, and became monsters. Omega Supreme saw the newly dubbed Monstructor for the uncontrollable abomination he was and took him down, though the clash between the two titans caused the destruction of Nova's capital, the Crystal City. After Nova Prime departed Cybertron in the Ark, Omega locked Monstructor's components in a dimensionally-displaced prison to live out the rest of their horrid existence.",

When he requested the 6-Star Dragon Ball, Moori had no choice but to give him what he asked for until three warrior-type Namekians arrived on the scene and attacked several members of the Frieza Force. Seizing his opportunity, he told his far younger brothers Dende and Cargo to run away before he flew up into the air and fired attacks at all 3 remaining un-destroyed Scouters on the battlefield. Seeing what he had done, Dodoria prepared to attack him until Frieza stopped him and ordered him to beat the three Namekians to death. Enraged, Moori prepared to fire an attack at Dodoria until Frieza (or Dodoria in the anime) fired a blast at Cargo, killing him instantly. Dodoria used Moori’s reaction as a brief window to attack him, eventually snapping his neck before continuing on their journey.",

Goro was the one to give her the nickname, \"Nyan.\" Once Nyan stumbled upon Earth, she began harvesting the sanity of humans to fuel the beacon. Nature itself rose to stop Nyan from reawakening her creators, stealing her powers and freezing her beneath the East Siberian Sea.",

Thousands of years later, when Soul Edge chose its new owner and unleashed the Evil Seed, Olcadan's seal was destroyed, allowing him to escape.",

    "Summary": "Overlord was born on Cybertron's second moon 4.2 million years ago, a rare breed known as a \"Point One Percenter\". After its \"first flash\" killed the hapless miners who discovered it, his spark was taken by the Functionist Council's authenticator Three-of-Twelve. In the days before the Cybertronian civil war, Overlord was both an avid spectator of Megatron's gladiatorial matches and a participant in the bouts, even fighting Megatron himself. Megatron would be the only opponent to ever defeat Overlord, and he did so regularly, giving Overlord a pathological fear of defeat. All the same, Overlord still joined Megatron's Decepticon faction upon its founding, though it was not the loftiness of the Decepticon cause that Megatron espoused which enticed him. Rather, it was the chance to have the glorious excess of the gladiator battles move beyond the arena, to encompass entire worlds. To Overlord, the ends didn't matter overly much when the means themselves were this pleasurable. As a result, his tactics developed a reputation as unsound, and his schemes as nothing more than flights of brutal whimsy. Unlike many other powerful Decepticons, he had no interest in command, only in taking his slaughter to the next stage. Megatron was not convinced, however, believing the image of Overlord as simply interested in killing to be a façade, and began searching for a way to exert greater control over him. Recognizing Overlord's power, Megatron regularly sparred with him, and eventually, three million years ago, selected him to be the fourth candidate for an upgrade process that would transform him into a world-shatteringly powerful superwarrior. Rendered virtually indestructible by an infusion of ununtrium to his endoskeleton, Overlord's first action as a member of the \"Warriors Elite\" was to smash out of his capsule and kill the scientist who oversaw the process, Rossum.",

Despite being the youngest of the previous set of Yonko, it is implied that he is on equal level with the experienced Kaidou, Charlotte Linlin, and even Whitebeard, who was feared as the strongest man in the world. When Shanks was younger, he and Buggy were both apprentice pirates in the Jolly Roger Pirate Crew, the crew of the late Pirate King, Gold Roger, and clashed with Whitebeard's crew several times. They were subordinate to Silvers Rayleigh, the first mate of the crew, and spent their time fighting each other. Both of them attended their captain's public execution, where they parted ways to form their own crews. Sometime afterward he became the rival of Dracule Mihawk. The duels between these two are remembered even by Whitebeard.",

Utterly relentless, totally without mercy, steadfastly unwilling to stop his attack until all that is left of his target is their smoldering remains, he is programmed only to feel hate. That, however, is also Trypticon's downfall—for all he can do is hate. He loathes the Autobots to the extent that he would destroy an entire city just to get at one, but he also hates his fellow Decepticons, and that, in turn, means he is not emotionally committed to their cause, as he sees just as little value in them and what they stand for as he does in anything else. Consequently, though he has accepted what he sees as his fated role as the ultimate Decepticon weapon, the war seems pointless and boring to him. It is a prison… and deep down, as much as he refuses to acknowledge it, the most powerful hatred Trypticon feels is hate for himself, for allowing him to be trapped in it.",

I know the work I do enables countless beings whom I will never even meet to be forged and live and dream and fall in love and create offspring and produce art and, yes, even to die. Am I melancholy? Perhaps, sometimes. But it is a small price to pay. As ever, I thank you for your interest in my own well-being.",

    "Summary": "The Xiliens returned as the villains in Godzilla Final Wars nearly four decades later. Intending to harvest the mitochondria from human cells for sustenance, they again posed as allies to humanity, unleashing an army of monsters under their control before teleporting them all away. When their plan was exposed by the Earth Defense Force, the Xilien Commander was assassinated and usurped by his subordinate who became the Controller of Planet X. The Controller unleashed all of the Xiliens' mind-controlled kaiju on Earth and tried to eliminate all resistance, but the surviving members of the EDF used the Gotengo to free Godzilla from his prison in Antarctica. Godzilla swiftly eliminated most of the Xiliens' monsters before the Controller summoned his ultimate weapon, Monster X, to stop him. The Gotengo breached the Xilien Mothership and its crew were able to defeat the Controller and his minions. In a final act, the Controller set the Mothership to self-destruct, but the Gotengo was able to escape in time and help Godzilla overcome Monster X's final form, Keizer Ghidorah.",

    "Summary": "Charlotte Linlin, more widely known as ‘Big Mom’, is the Captain of the Big Mom Pirates and the only female member of the Yonko. A sixty-eight years old obese woman, who has both an enormous physique and an incredible capacity for destruction, Charlotte Linlin has been in the business of piracy since she was just a child, and became widely feared by all for her utter lack of restraint, never learning how to curb back her monstrous strength. But the one thing that people fear about her above anything else is her boundless appetite, which often propels her into hunger-crazed rampages. Among other things, she was introduced by eating some of her own men like snacks. Big Mom has eaten the Soru Soru no Mi, which allows her to take portions of souls out of a person (reducing their lifespan) and redistribute them into inanimate objects and even animals, granting them sentience and/or anthropomorphism.",

    "Summary": "Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・Ｄディー・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi?), known as \"Straw Hat Luffy\", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He's the son of Monkey D. Dragon, a revolutionary considered \"The World's Most Dangerous Criminal\"; the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, a powerful Marine Vice-Admiral who had cornered the late Pirate King himself on several occasions; the sworn brother of late \"Fire Fist\" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo; and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He seeks to find One Piece and become the Pirate King; to accomplish this, he founded the Straw Hat Pirates and set out on the high seas at age 17 in search of the elusive treasure, beginning a series of increasingly odd and dangerous adventures. He has eaten the Gum-Gum Fruit, which turned his body into rubber and gives him stretching powers; he's developed great mastery and creativity with his powers, creating two unique techniques with them: Gear 2nd, which makes him much faster, and Gear 3rd, which allows him to inflate any body parts for a stronger attack. During the time-skip, he has a new technique: Gear 4th, which makes him much stronger and faster than even the other two Gears, but with a considerable cost to it. During his battle with Kaidou in Onigashima, Luffy manages to awaken the true potential of his Devil Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika, tapping into his Gear 5th, granting his rubber-like body increased physical strength and freedom, limited only by his imagination.",

    "Summary": "Shanks is Monkey D. Luffy's idol, inspiring him to take up a pirate life, and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World. Unlike Whitebeard, Kaidou, and Big Mom, he doesn't lord this status over everyone else, preferring to travel to different stops and party, with a special fondness for drinking. Despite being the youngest of the previous set of Yonko, it is implied that he is on equal level with the experienced Kaidou, Charlotte Linlin, and even Whitebeard, who was feared as the strongest man in the world. When Shanks was younger, he and Buggy were both apprentice pirates in the Jolly Roger Pirate Crew, the crew of the late Pirate King, Gold Roger, and clashed with Whitebeard's crew several times. They were subordinate to Silvers Rayleigh, the first mate of the crew, and spent their time fighting each other. Both of them attended their captain's public execution, where they parted ways to form their own crews. Sometime afterward he became the rival of Dracule Mihawk. The duels between these two are remembered even by Whitebeard.",
